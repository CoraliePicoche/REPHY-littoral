The persistence of phytoplanktonic diversity in spite of competition for basic resources has long been a source of wonder and inspiration to ecologists. To sort out, among the many coexistence mechanisms suggested by theory and experiments, which ones actually maintain diversity in natural ecosystems, long-term field studies are paramount. Here, we analyse a large dataset of phytoplankton abundance time series, counted every two weeks over 20 years, at 10 sites along the French coastline. We estimate biotic interactions using dynamic, multispecies autoregressive models. We show that a strong self-regulation, with competition strength within a genus an order of magnitude higher than between genera, was present in all phytoplanktonic interaction networks. This much weaker intergenus competition suggests that niche differentiation (rather than neutrality) is commonplace in phytoplankton. Furthermore, the fraction of positive net effects between phytoplanktonic taxa was above 50% of non-zero interactions on average and at least 40% in all sites. Both strong self-regulation and widespread net facilitation should therefore be key features of coexistence mechanisms intending to explain phytoplankton diversity maintenance.
