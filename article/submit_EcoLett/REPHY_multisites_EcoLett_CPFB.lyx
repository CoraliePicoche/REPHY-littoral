Abstract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The persistence of phytoplanktonic diversity in spite of potentially strong
 competition is a long-standing puzzle of ecology.
 Here, we analyse a large dataset of phytoplankton abundance time series,
 counted every two weeks over twenty years, at ten sites along the French
 coastline.
 We estimate biotic interaction strengths using dynamic, multivariate autoregres
sive models.
 We show that a strong self-regulation, with competition strength within
 a taxon (genus) an order of magnitude higher than between taxa, was present
 in all interaction networks.
 This much stronger intra-genus competition suggests that niche differentiation
 - rather than neutrality - was commonplace.
 Facilitation was also widespread, being even more frequent that inter-genus
 competition.
 While network stability was unrelated to complexity measures, we unveiled
 links between self-regulation, inter-genus interaction strengths and abundance.
 Strong self-regulation, widespread facilitation and stabilizing covariances
 between interaction strengths seem to be common features of coexisting
 phytoplanktonic communities in the field.

How species or close genera can coexist together in spite of competition
 is one of the main puzzles of community ecology, especially for primary
 producers that seemingly share the same basic resources

 Many theoretical studies of competition models have shown that competitive
 exclusion is likely in those circumstances

However, the evidence gathered from terrestrial plant communities starts
 to suggest that, in fact, niche rather than neutral processes may be paramount
 to explain coexistence, with intraspecific competition dwarfing interspecific
 competition in most cases

 Whether these conclusions drawn from studies of annual plants and forest
 trees apply to other ecosystems and taxa is currently little known (but

Moreover, even within a single trophic level, competition may not be the
 rule: the meta-analysis by

 usually tend to think.
 Although some theoretical studies suggest that facilitative interactions
 can be destabilizing (

\begin_layout Standard
Here, we analyse a spatially replicated, long-term community-level dataset,
 consisting of ten multivariate time series of phytoplankton abundance along
 the French coastline.
 The time series are modelled using multivariate autoregressive (MAR) models,
 allowing for interactions between genera.
 Although many ecological studies focus on interactions between species,
 competition has been shown experimentally to occur between different genera
 of phytoplankton 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "titman_ecological_1976,descamps-julien_stable_2005"

\end_inset

.
 The genus level is also a rather fine taxonomic scale for phytoplankton
 interaction studies, as most studies are restricted to interaction between
 different classes or even phyla 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ives_estimating_2003,hampton_sixty_2008,griffiths_phytoplankton_2015"

\end_inset

.
 Studying interactions between different genera of phytoplankton therefore
 both makes empirical sense in light of competition experiments and allows
 to estimate better-resolved networks.
 We focus here on genera that belong mostly to diatoms and dinoflagellates.
 To put our results into a more general context, we then compare our interaction
 strength estimates to previously published interaction networks produced
 under the same statistical framework, both in plankton and other empirical
 systems.

Sampling methods

All phytoplankton counts were collected by Ifremer coastal laboratories
 as part of the National Phytoplankton and Phycotoxin Monitoring Network
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "REPHY_db"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Since 1987, this monitoring program has required the sampling of 26 sites
 along the French coastline every 2 weeks within 2 hours of high tide to
 document both biotic (phytoplankton counts) and abiotic (water temperature,
 salinity) variables.
 We focused on sites which had the longest time series.
 We also excluded time series which had missing data for over 6 months or
 an average delay between sampling dates above 20 days.
 This reduced the number of study sites to 10 sites nested within 4 regions
 (Brittany, Oléron, Arcachon and the Mediterranean Sea; Fig.
\begin_inset space ~

S1 and Table S1).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Abiotic variables (temperature, salinity) were measured directly from the
 boat during the sampling process while water samples for biotic analyses
 were fixed with a Lugol's solution and examined later.
 Phytoplankton cells above 20 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$

 the Utermöhl method using an optical microscope 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "utermohl_zur_1958"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Throughout the years and sites, more than 600 taxa were identified at different
 taxonomic levels.
 We aggregated them at the genus (or group of genera when not possible)
 level based on previous work (Table S2; 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "hernandez_farinas_assessing_2015,barraquand_coastal_2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), except for cryptophytes and euglenophytes in Arcachon, which could not
 be identified below the family level.
 Although the taxonomic resolution used here may seem coarse in comparison
 to land plants, it is in fact more refined than 86% of the MAR(1) studies
 of phytoplankton listed in Table

For each region, the MAR(1) analysis focused on the most abundant and most
 frequently observed genera to avoid most of the gaps in the time series.
 Time series are plotted in Fig.

 When gaps did not exceed a month, missing values were linearly interpolated;
 remaining missing values were replaced by a random number between 0 and
 half of the lowest observed abundance

, including nutrients and hydrodynamics variables.
 We found that hydrodynamics variables were more influential than nutrients;
 nutrient dynamics contributed little to phytoplankton dynamics on the two-week
 timescale.
 Because temperature and salinity sum up seasonal changes in light as well
 as hydrology (salinity is inversely related to freshwater inflow), these
 represent the two key drivers needed to account for abiotic influences

 The analysis of real data in

 which confirmed the ability of MAR(1) models to infer biotic interactions
 and abiotic forcings.
 There was no need to account for extra non-linearities to model relative
 nonlinearities or a storage effect, as these were found to be non-existent
 (through threshold autoregressive models,

 Other aspects of the MAR(1) modelling are likewise quite robust: using

 the full set used in

 the Arcachon study site.
 Even if some departures from the true data-generating model may not always
 be detectable through MAR(1) diagnostics (e.g., residuals), simulation work
 has showed that MAR(1) models are in general robust to nonlinearities

For ease of interpretation of MAR(1) interaction coefficients, we also prove
 the correspondence between the magnitude of intra/inter interaction strength
 in a MAR(1) model and a multispecies Beverton-Holt model, i.e., a discrete-time

In this study, the number of phytoplankton taxa, 
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

, and the community composition varies slightly between regions but sites
 share on average 67% of their taxa.
 In order to have comparable models, we also keep the same 2 covariates,
 i.e., water temperature and salinity, that were measured at all study sites.
 Therefore, the dimension of the dynamical system mostly depends on the
 (square of the) number of phytoplankton taxa we study, which ranges between
 7 (Mediterranean Sea) and 14 (Brittany).
 The smallest system still requires 70 parameters to be estimated if we
 consider all possible interactions between taxa.
 To reduce this dimensionality and remove unnecessary parameters, we compared
 different `interaction scenarios' based on BIC (Fig
\begin_inset space ~

S3), which proved to be satisfactory in our previous analyses of both real
 data and similar simulated datasets

 The null interaction scenario assumed no interaction between groups of
 species (diagonal interaction matrix) and was compared to four other interactio
n scenarios.
 The first interaction scenario assumed that interactions could only occur
 between phylogenetically close organisms, i.e., within a class (groups were
 then diatoms, dinoflagellates, and other phytoplanktonic organisms) while
 the second interaction scenario further differentiated pennate and centric
 diatoms.
 The third interaction scenario considered the reverse hypothesis, that
 only unrelated organisms could interact (i.e., a diatom could only interact
 with a dinoflagellate or a cryptophyte, but not with another diatom), and
 the last interaction scenario did not constrain the interactions at all
 (full interaction matrix).
 The second interaction scenario, hereafter called the pennate-centric scenario,
 had the lowest BIC for all sites (Fig.
 S3).
 This parsimonious scenario was therefore chosen as the basis for further
 investigations of network structure.

 We compared the maximum modulus of the eigenvalues of the pennate/centric
 matrices in each site, as a proxy of stability, to network metrics which
 could be related to complexity, such as weighted connectance and linkage
 density 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "bersier_quantitative_2002"

\end_inset

.
 Weighted connectance is a measure of the proportion of realized links,
 taking into account the shape of the flux distribution, while link density
 measures the average proportion and strength of interactions for a given
 taxon.
 These metrics are adapted to weighted interaction matrices but cannot accomodat
e for both positive and negative coefficients: we therefore chose to focus
 on the absolute values of these coefficients, which can be linked to their
 strength, irrespective of interaction sign.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to these network-level metrics, we also computed the average
 vulnerability (average effect of other taxa on a focal taxon, Eq
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

S5) and impact (average effect of a focal taxon on other taxa, Eq
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

S6) on both raw and absolute values of the coefficients, and compared these
 to the regulation a focal species exerted on itself.
 Raw values indicate the average effect (i.e., is the effect of others mostly
 positive or negative?) that can be expected on a taxon' growth rate from
 other planktonic species while absolute effects characterise the strength
 of all types of interactions on a taxon (i.e., is a taxon strongly affected
 by the others?).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we compared our results on the ratio between mean self-regulation
 (intrataxon interaction strength) and mean intertaxa interaction strength
 to other published studies based on a MAR(1) model.
 A list of references is given in Table
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

S3.
 Authors usually reported only coefficients that were significant at the
 95% significance threshold, thus ignoring potentially many weak effects.
 This implies that there are two ways of computing the mean intertaxa interactio
ns, i.e., taking the mean value of all coefficients outside of the matrix
 diagonal, including zeroes (which decreases the estimated mean intertaxa
 interaction strength), and the mean value of statistically significant
 intertaxa coefficients only (which increases the estimated mean intertaxa
 interaction strength, Fig.
 S8).
 We should mention two potential biases associated with this comparison
 across the published literature.
 First, low-dimensional matrices tended to be more complete (less sparse)
 than high-dimensional matrices, as these small interaction matrices were
 used to study known interaction phenomena (observed predation between organisms
, for instance).
 Conversely, the number of parameters to estimate increases as the square
 of the number of interacting taxa, leading most authors to reduce this
 set before the estimation process for large interaction matrices.
 There is therefore a positive correlation between sparsity and dimensionality
 (Fig
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

S9).
 A second caveat is that while we informed our model selection by phylogeny
 (see above), several authors have instead reduced the number of estimated
 parameters by an automated procedure, usually based on the comparison of
 100 randomly chosen interaction matrices by BIC 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "ives_estimating_2003"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 The latter choice is likely to bias high non-zero interactions in the literatur
e.
 This is why we decided to present in the main text intra/inter ratios including
 interspecific (or intergroup) coefficients set to zero, which should be
 less sensitive to the model selection method and therefore make comparisons
 across studies possible.

 Best-fitting models corresponded to a phylogenetically-structured interaction
 scenario, where interaction only occurred betwen closely related genera
 (Fig
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

S3).
 This led to sparse, modular matrices that have two main features.
 First, we observe a strong self-regulation for all sites (Fig.

 The ratio of mean intragenus to intergenus interaction coefficients varies
 between 6 and 10, not counting coefficients set to 0 in the estimation
 process.
 If we include the zeroes in the interaction matrix in the computation of
 the intra/inter mean interaction strength, the ratio rises to 21-43.
 Therefore, intragenus interactions are on average much stronger than intergenus
 interactions, approximately 10 to 20 times stronger.

Second, although the percentage of facilitative interactions seemed to vary
 among sites (between 40% and 71% of interactions in the selected models),
 facilitation remained predominant in 9 sites out of 10 (only Lazaret, in
 the Mediterranean Sea, has 60% negative interactions).
 Our observational setup being nested, with sites within regions, we can
 examine whether locally positive interactions remain positive in a regional
 context: the percentage of consistently positive interactions at the regional
 level varies between 30% and 53%, higher than the percentage of similarly
 defined negative interactions (between 15% and 40%), except for sites in
 the Mediterranean Sea.

We have found that the percentage of true mutualism (+/+) is substantial:
 averaged over all sites, 32% of all interactions are (+/+) while only 12%
 of them are (-/-), see also Fig

S5.
 The sign correspondence is not always maintained between French regions:
 the only interaction that is non-zero in the 10 sites (CHA/SKE) is mutualistic
 in Men er Roue only (Brittany) and mixed (+/-) at all other sites.
 Within the same region, however, interactions measured at different sites
 tend to keep the same sign.
 In the 3 sites of Oléron, for instance, there were 4 interactions which
 remained positive on both sides (CHA/GUI, DIT/GUI, LEP/THP, SKE/THP), 3
 of them being also mutualistic in some of the Brittany sites.
 This contradicts previous observations that mutualistic interactions tend
 to be more context-dependent than competitive interactions

): genera that were more self-regulating also had also a higher vulnerability
 score and a lower impact score.
 Those two influences are likely to trade-off: a high degree of self-regulation
 somehow buffers outside influences.
 Taxa that were less self-regulating were also more likely to have a broad
 range of effects onto other taxa.
 As these genera tended to be more abundant (Fig

S7), they were more likely to affect other genera.
 It is important to note, however, that these trends are weak and there
 is therefore a considerable amount of randomness dominating the interaction
 matrix: many scenarios of self-regulation vs limitation by others are therefore
 possible.

 We found that the order of magnitude of intra/inter interaction strengths

 systems to which MAR(1) models have been fitted, considering that our systems
 are relatively high-dimensional and that the higher the number of taxa,
 the larger the intraspecific regulation

 on less diverse communities, where interactions are stronger.
 The conclusion from this comparison seems to be that, unlike small communities
 that can be tight-knit, any diverse system of competitors and facilitators
 has evolved large niche differences making intragroup competition much
 larger in magnitude than intergroup interactions.

Strong self-regulation and facilitation

\begin_layout Standard
We found very large niche differences between genera, translating into much
 higher intragenus than intergenus effects on growth rates (i.e., strong self-regu

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rather high intra/intertaxon interaction strength ratio 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "levine_importance_2009"

\end_inset

 that we found, from 5 to 20, depending on how one counts the interactions
 set to zero in the estimation process, could appear extremely high in light
 of previous intra/interspecific competition strength estimates of 4 to
 5 by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Even though their model is a different one, i.e., Lotka-Volterra competition,
 we prove in the Supplementary Information that the intra/inter ratio should
 remain commensurate.
 The difference in the intra/inter ratio that we found should therefore
 lie elsewhere, which requires some explanation.
 First, one could argue that such high intra/inter ratio arises because
 we consider the genus as our baseline taxonomic unit, rather than the species.
 Although it is logical that niche differentiation increases as one gets
 up the phylogenetic tree, and that getting down to the species level could
 slightly decrease that ratio, there are two arguments suggesting that the
 niche differences found here extend to the species level.
 First, phytoplankton species belonging to different genera are often found
 to compete in experiments 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\change_unchanged
In the field-based dataset studied here, the same genera that are considered
 in experiments are found not to compete (or only weakly), hence there must
 be some niche differentiation occurring in the field but not in the lab.
 Second, the only other study that managed to provide MAR(1) estimates down
 to the species level for phytoplankton, that of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "huber_role_2006"

\end_inset

, provides an intra/interspecific strength ratio similar to ours (point

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
 Strong self-regulation seems therefore a genuine feature of field phytoplankton
ic communities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another main finding of our study is the large frequency of positive interaction
s, with 30% truly mutualistic (+/+) interactions and between 40 and 70%
 facilitative effects.
 This again can be compared to the meta-analysis by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "adler_competition_2018"

\end_inset

 who also found facilitative interactions, but less than here (
\begin_inset Formula $\approx$
\end_inset

30%).
 However, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

's review contains many experiments while the plant literature is replete
 with field examples of facilitation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "brooker_facilitation_2008,mcintire2014facilitation"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, so that plant facilitation could be higher in the field.
 At the moment, it is therefore unknown how the predominance of facilitative
 interactions that we found in phytoplankton compares to facilitation in
 terrestrial plants.
 We note that several authors using MAR(1) models previously forbade positive
 interactions within the same trophic level, so that the fraction of facilitativ
e interactions in plankton cannot be computed from literature-derived MAR(1)
 estimates.

 Though natural enemies are good candidates to explain the observed niche
 differences and emerging facilitation, one must bear in mind that other
 known drivers of phytoplankton dynamics such as allelopathy

 Finally, resources that are usually considered limiting for all species
 might in fact not always be: the changes in phytoplankton absorption spectrum

No complexity-stability relationship but connections between self-regulation
 and intergroup interactions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was no relation between the complexity of the communities (measured
 as either the weighted connectance or linkage density of the interaction
 matrices) and their stability, as measured by the dominant eigenvalue of
 the interaction matrix, which measures the return time to a point equilibrium
 (i.e., resilience).
 This result is conditional upon our model being a good approximate description
 of the system (i.e., no multiyear limit cycles or chaotic attractors as the
 mapping between eigenvalues and actual stability is distorted in that case
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 However, we already showed on a subset of this data that a fixed point

 accurate description of the system 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "barraquand_coastal_2018"

 Therefore, we are confident that the absence of complexity-resilience found
 here is genuine.
 This absence of direct link between complexity and stability could be an
 actual feature of empirical systems, as shown previously by

 We also found that the percentage of mutualistic interactions, that is
 thought to affect the stability of the network

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to weighted connectance, indices at the network-level (e.g., linkage
 density) and at the species or genus level (vulnerability and impact) approxima
te the average effects exerted and sustained by any given taxa in the different
 study sites.
 While, at the network level, network structure (either complexity measures
 or the percentage of mutualistic interactions) did not affect stability,
 a relation emerged between self-regulation, necessary for coexistence,
 and genus-level indices.
 We found that the more a genus is self-regulated, the more it tends to
 be vulnerable to other genera impacts and the less it impacts other genera.
 We examined whether vulnerability and impact could be affected by phylogenetic
 correlations; they were not as on Fig.

 points were not clustered according to genus, family or phylum.
 High self-regulation usually indicates large niche differences with the
 rest of the community, and it makes therefore sense that a species/genus
 whose needs strongly differ from the others only marginally impacts the
 resources of the other coexisting species.
 This is what we expect under strong niche partitioning.
 Furthermore, a low self-regulation was correlated with high average abundance,
 which echoes findings by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 who found that rare species usually show stronger self-regulation.
 This correlation between rarity and self-regulation could also explain
 the lesser impact effect of high self-regulated species/genus: a taxon
 which dominates the community composition can have a major effect on the
 others, especially as they usually cover more space, while it is harder
 for rare, localised taxa to have large impacts.
 However, it was more difficult to explain the relationship between self-regulat
ion and vulnerability: a genus that is more self-regulated and rarer was
 found here to be on average more vulnerable to other genera's increases
 in densities.
 Such relation implies greater stability (

, and also invariability,

key "Arnoldi431296"

\end_inset

) for the network as a whole, because the taxa that are the most vulnerable
 to other taxa's impacts are also those whose dynamics are intrinsically
 more buffered.
 By which mechanisms this could happen is so far unclear and open to speculation.
 It could be just a 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

mass effect
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

: common taxa are in high enough numbers to deplete resources or change
 the environment in ways that affects the rarer ones, but the reverse is
 not true.
 We caution, however, that the relationships between vulnerability, impact
 and self-regulation that we evidenced are all relatively weak: considerable
 stochasticity still dominates the distribution of interaction matrix coefficien
ts.

Overall, the dominance of niche differentiation in observational plankton
 studies – based on our analysis of the REPHY dataset and re-analysis of
 the MAR(1) literature – is similar to what has been recently found in plant
 community studies

 or empirically parameterized food webs including horizontal diversity

\end_inset

.
 Large niche differences might be due to the ghost of the competition past,
 i.e., competition has occurred in the past, leading to strong selection and
 subsequent evolution leading to progressive niche separation.
 In this scenario, species have evolved niches that allow them not to compete
 or to interact only weakly (very strong facilitative effects might be likewise
 destabilizing

 The likely predator effects that we highlighted above could be comprised
 within such niche differentiation

 Both predators and resources have often symmetrical effects and can therefore

\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

, suggests by contrast that spatial distributions in relation to abiotic
 factors might have a large impact on the interaction strengths inferred
 from temporal interaction models such as ours.
 Recent combinations of model fitting and removal experiments have shown
 that the model fitting usually underestimates the effect of competitors
 that are uncovered by removal experiments

key "tuck_strong_2018,adler_weak_2018"

.
 This could occur for instance if species are spatially segregated (at a
 small scale) because each species only exists within a domain where it
 is relatively competitive (Pacala's spatial segregation hypothesis 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "pacala1997biologically"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), while a focal species could spread out if competitors were removed.
 This means that a species can be limited by competitors, but act so as
 to minimize competition (a little like avoidance behaviour in animals),
 which implies that competition is in effect hard to detect when all species
 are present.
 This would require spatial segregation between phytoplankton species at
 the scale of interactions, i.e., at the microscale.
 At the moment, it is known that turbulence generates inhomogeneities at
 the microscale 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "barton_impact_2014,breier_emergence_2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 but it is quite unclear how this affects multivariate spatial patterns
 of species distributions (

).
 Moreover, even if turbulence generates spatial structure with segregation
 between species, it is not quite clear that the 
\begin_inset Quotes eld

\end_inset

 mechanism could work for plankton, because turbulence rather than organism
 movement dictates where the phytoplankton patches can or cannot appear.
