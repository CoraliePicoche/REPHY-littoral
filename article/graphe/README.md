This folder contains all the figures, and a few text files, that were used in the manuscript, supporting information and responses to the referees during the review process, as well as further vizualisations of the data that can be useful to understand data and models. A brief description of each figure is given below.

* `abundance.pdf` compares the summed abundance of the studied genera to the abundance of all phytolanktonic organisms over time, as well as their ratio
* `abundance_vs_regulation.pdf` shows the relationship between the mean abundance of a genus and it self-regulation
* `abiotic_first_try.pdf` and `abiotic_second_try.pdf` shows the covariate (temperature, salinity) effects on the species in each site. 
* `biotic_interaction_matrices_MainFig_allin1_v4.pdf` presents the interactions between species at each site 
* `*_corcoef.txt` contains the values of the correlations between parameters for each study site, also shown on the figures `correlation_between_interaction*.pdf`
* `comp_per_BIC.pdf` presents the BIC of different interaction scenarios at each site
* `comparaison_ratio_code_nolog_cleaner_ONLY_SIGNIF_withoutBarraquand_et_al_2018.pdf` shows the ratio between intra and inter-genus interaction strengths for different studies including ours
* `complexity_stability_*.pdf` shows the relation between resilience and network descriptors (% of positive interactions, weighted connectance...) for the pennate-centric interaction scenario presented in the manuscript and the unconstrained interaction model presented in the supporting information. The same figure was also done with different colors depending on the interactions taken into account, that is, positive or negative (`test_on_coefficient_sign`)
* `distrib_comp_pencen*.pdf` shows the distribution of the interaction coefficients, either at each site or gathered. Notations no0 or with0 correspond to cases where only coefficients different from 0, or all coefficients are taken into account, respectively.
* `moy_vs_var_for_all_interactions_pencen_*.pdf` shows the relationship between mean and variance for intra- and inter-genus interaction strengths at each site. In the clusterized version of the figure, the same is shown, with different groups defined as "C-Centric", "P-Pennate","D-Dinoflagellate", "O-Others", i.e. the clusters of interactions in our model.
* `nutrients.pdf` shows the time series of Nitrogen, Phosophorus and Silicon at each site when available
* `pencen_generality_vs_regulation*.pdf` shows the impact and vulnerability of each species as a function of its self-regulation.The same figure is also available for the unconstrained matrix in `unconstrained_generality_vs_vulnerability_MainFig.pdf` In the `testSP` version, points were replaced by the names of the genera to see if certain genera had the same behaviour at each site. The `generality_AND_vulnerability` version only show impact and vulnerability for each genus.
* `Ratio_function_dim.pdf` shows the effect of the number of species in a system on the intra-/inter- ratio
* `sparsity_vs_others_` presents the relation between matrix sparsity and time series length or number of taxa in other MAR studies
* `time_series_plankton_*` present different time series of abundances (most abundant, all sites, or with a focus on only one genus)
