Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
How species or related genera can coexist together in spite of likely competitio
n is still one of the main puzzles of community ecology, especially for
 primary producers that seemingly share the same basic resources [REFS].
 Many theoretical studies of competition models have shown that competitive
 exclusion is likely in those circumstances [REFs], unless some special
 mechanisms involving spatial or temporal variation are at play

 Second, although the percentage of facilitative interactions seem to vary
 among sites [insert percentages here], we have found that it is substantial
 for all sites: contrary to our initial expectations, commensalism (the
 interactions are rarely two-way mutualism [check]) seems to be the rule
 rather than the exception.

We then asked whether the stability (resilience) of those matrices was affected
 by the percentage of mutualistic interactions or their connectivity properties
 (Fig.
 2).
 
\change_deleted -2100369821 1544027657
Neither the percentage of mutualistic interactions nor the complexity metrics
 did strongly affect the stability properties, although there was perhaps
 a slight decline with the percentage of mutualistic interactions (but it
 may be simply due to an unbalance in this percentage, usually high, in
 the datasets).

 [REF? There's this Am Nat paper by Alex Best I think on what's currently
 amiss with random matrix theory...]
\change_unchanged
.
 We defined two scores, vulnerability (summed effect of others on the focal
 species growth rate) and generality (summed effect of the focal species
 onto other species growth rates).
 Species that were more self-regulating also had also a higher vulnerability
 score, and those two influences are likely to trade-off: a high degree
 of self-regulation somehow buffers outside influences.
 Species that were less self-regulating were also more likely to have a
 broad range of effects onto other species [to interpret this we may also
 need to check that they were more abundant, if so I would say that species
 varying broadly have a higher likelihood to generate effects in other species].
 It is important to note, however, that these patterns are weak and there
 is therefore a considerable amount of randomness dominating the interaction
 matrix: many scenarios of self-regulation vs limitation by others are therefore
 possible.

 Can we relate some of the species that have widespread effects on many

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aside from these trade-offs, some of which promote some stability (sensu
 invariability), we found no remarkable patterns of covariation between
 matrix elements (other than a mean-variance scaling of interaction coefficients
, see SI XXX Fig.
 XXX).
 The big finding of our study seems really to be the presence of very large
 niche differences between the species, translating into a much higher intragrou
p competition, together with a high degree of facilitative net interactions.
 In our previous publication [REF], we have argued that those could arise
 from predation effects that could well create apparent mutualism between
 prey species and strong intragroup density-dependence [REFs].
 This is still very much likely here given our new study regions (Oléron,
 Britanny, Mediterranean) could have similar predators, though there are
 other possibilities.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we have sought to put these results in a broader context by compiling
 the intra vs.
 inter group estimates of previous MAR(1) studies (detailed in Appendix
 XXX).
 We have found that the order of magnitude of intra/inter interaction strengths
 considered here (
\begin_inset Formula $\approx$
\end_inset

 10) not particularly below those found for most planktonic systems.
 We include in Fig.
 4 not only plankton studies but also a couple of vertebrate or insect studies
 on smaller (less diverse) communities were interactions are stronger.
 The conclusion from this comparison seems to be that any diverse system
 of competitors and facilitators seem to have evolved large niche differences
 making intragroup competition much higher than intergroup interactions.

 evolution leading to progressive niche separation.
 Species have evolved niches that allow them not to compete or to interact
 only weakly (very strong facilitative effects might be likewise destabilizing
 [je crois qu'il y a des refs sur les effets non-monotone des interactions
 +, je rechercherai]).
 The predator effects that we highlighted above can be comprised within
 such niche differentation sensu largo: specialized predators can make strong
 conspecific density-dependence emerge [REFs], while switching generalists
 can also promote diversity [REFs, same from Oikos].
 Both predators and resources have often symmetrical effects and can contribute
 to niche differentation

 This could occur for instance if species are spatially segregated (at a
 small scale) because each species only exists within a domain where it
 is relatively competitive, while a focal species could spread out if competitor
s were removed.
 This means that a species can be limited by competitors, but act so as
 to minimize competition (a little like avoidance behaviour in animals)
 so that competition is i effect hard to detect when all species are present.
 This would require some fine-scale segregation between phytoplankton species
 at the scale of interactions, i.e., at the microscale.
 At the moment, it is known that turbulence generates inhomogeneities at
 the microscale

[Not sure about what I am writing below, some ideas about the resistant
 / benthic life stage – if there were strong competition in a well-mixed
 media but a stage structure, we would still expect to see some degree of
 competition in the pelagic surveys I think – my guess would be that competition
 between the pelagic stage is always weak because of hidden spatial structure,
 and resistant life-stage only adds to this the possibility for

 coexistence because recolonization from zero without outside flow becomes
 possible.]

A final possibility relates to stage structure.
 We have so far referred to the pelagic component of the phytoplankton community
, which is what is sampled and analysed here.
 However, many of the organisms followed here have resistance form.
 These resistance forms, that can sink to the sea bottom, can easily be
 remobilized in the water column after storms, which combined to a rise
 in irradiance, can generate blooms.
 This may greatly help coexistence by frequent recolonization in the coastal
 and therefore shallow marine habitats that are considered here, and may
 dampen or even hide the possible effects of competition.

The completeness of the time series depended on the accessibility of each
 study site.We selected 10 sites in 4 regions (Brittany, Marennes-Oléron,
 Arcachon and the Mediterranean Sea, a map is shown in the Supplementary
 Information) based on their compliance with the sampling design.
 For each species, the frequency of observations depended on local commonness
 and identification difficulty.
 For each region, we focused on the most abundant and most frequently observed
 species and we chose to restrain our analyses to the years after 1995,
 in which an important taxonomy training took place.
 When gaps did not exceed a month, missing values were lineraly interpolated
 and remaining missing values were replaced by a random number between 0
 and half of the lowest observed abundance

In this study, the number of phytoplankton groups, S, varies between region
 but we keep the same 2 covariates, i.e.
 water temperature and salinity.
 Therefore, the dimension of the equation system only depends on the number
 of groups we study, which ranges between 7 (Mediterranean Sea) and 14 (Brittany
).
 The smallest system still requires 70 parameters to be estimated if we
 consider all possible interactions between species.
 Before analyzing these parameters, we wondered if such over-parameterization
 was necessary and compared different 'interaction scenarios' based on BIC.
 Our null model assumed no interaction between groups of species (diagonal
 interaction matrix) and was compared to four other models.
 The first model assumed that interactions could only occur between phylogenetic
ally close organisms, i.e., within a class (namely, diatoms, dinoflagellates,
 and other phytoplanktonic organisms) while the second model further differentia
ted pennate and centric diatoms, The third model considered the inverse
 hypothesis that only unrelated organisms could interact (i.e., a diatom could
 only interact with a dinoflagellate or a cryptophyte, but not with another
 diatom), and the last model did not constrain the interactions at all (full
 interaction matrix).
 Based on convergent results in all sites (see Supplementary Information),
 we further investigated the second model, hereafter called the pennate-centric
 model.

 the stability of a system

 We compared the maximum modulus of the eigenvalues of the pennate/centric
 matrices in each site, as a proxy of stability, to complexity-related metrics
 such as weighted connectance and linkage density
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand supercite
key "breier_emergence_2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Weighted connectance is a measure of the proportion of realized links,
 taking into account the shape of the flux distribution,while link density
 measures the average proportion and strength of interactions for a given
 species.
 These metrics are adapted to weighted interaction matrix but cannot accomodate
 for both positive and negative coefficients: we therefore chose to focus
 on the absolute values of these coefficients, which can be linked to their
 strength even though we do not necessarily know the kind of interaction
 it describes.

In addition to these network-level metrics, we also computed the average
 vulnerability (average effect of other taxa on a focal taxon) and generality
 (average effect of a focal taxon on other taxa) and compared these to the
 regulation a focal species exerted on itself.

Finally, we compared our results on self regulation v.
 interspecific interactions to results found in the literature with the
 same analyses.
 A list of the references is given in the Supplementary Information.
 Most of the time, authors only report significant coefficients and ignore
 weak effects.
 We therefore computed the mean interspecific interactions a either the
 mean value of significant coefficients only (see Supplementary Information),
 or the mean value of all coefficients outside of the matrix diagonal, replacing
 missing values by 0 (Fig.
