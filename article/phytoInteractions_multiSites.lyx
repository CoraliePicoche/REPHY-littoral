\begin_layout Title
Strong self-regulation and widespread facilitative interactions between
 groups of phytoplankton

\begin_layout Abstract

The persistence of phytoplanktonic diversity in spite of competition for
 basic resources has long been a source of wonder and inspiration to ecologists.
 To sort out, among the many coexistence mechanisms suggested by theory
 and experiments, which ones actually maintain diversity in natural ecosystems,
 long-term field studies are paramount.
 Here, we analyze a large dataset of phytoplankton abundance time series,
 counted every two weeks over 20 years, at 10 sites along the French coastline.
 We estimate biotic interactions using dynamic, multispecies autoregressive
 models.
 We show that a strong self-regulation, with intraspecific competition strength
 an order of magnitude higher than interspecific, was a key feature of phytoplan
ktonic interaction networks.
 Furthermore, positive net effects between phytoplanktonic taxa constituted
 at least 40% of non-null interactions in all sites.
 Both strong self-regulation and widespread net facilitation should therefore
 be key features of coexistence mechanisms purporting to explain phytoplankton
 diversity maintenance.

We haven't discussed this, but perhaps differences in composition between
 sites can say things about competition that long term time series cannot

How species or related genera can coexist together in spite of likely competitio
n is still one of the main puzzles of community ecology, especially for
 primary producers that seemingly share the same basic resources

 Many theoretical studies of competition models have shown that competitive
 exclusion is likely in those circumstances

 Neutral theory, that in its most basic formulation assumes equal competitive
 abilities

 and non-equilibrium coexistence sustained by immigration from a larger

 However, the evidence gathered from plant communities starts to suggest
 that, in fact, niche rather than neutral processes may be paramount, with
 intraspecific competition dwarfing interspecific competition in most cases

 Whether these conclusions apply to other systems is currently unknown.

Moreover, the meta-analysis by Adler et al.

 than ecologists usually tend to think.
 Although some theoretical studies suggest that facilitative interactions
 can be destabilizing (sensu resilience) and therefore undermine coexistence

 – i.e., Jacobian

\change_unchanged
matrices on the logarithmic scale
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 – that have two main features.
 First, we observe a strong self-regulation for all sites (Fig.

\end_inset

.
 Second, although the percentage of facilitative interactions seem to vary
 among sites (between 40% and 71% of interactions in the selected models),
 we have found that the percentage of mutualism is substantial for all sites:
 
\change_inserted -2100369821 1546536394
there are on average 32% of all interactions which are beneficial for both
 interacting groups, 12% which are detrimental.
 Remaining interactions can either characterize competitive effects or commensal
ism.
\change_deleted -2100369821 1546536401
contrary to our initial expectations, commensalism (the interactions are
 rarely two-way mutualism [check][Please do ;)]) seems to be the rule rather
 than the exception
\change_unchanged
.
 Our observational setup being nested, with sites within regions, we can
 examine whether locally positive interactions remain positive in a regional
 context: the percentage of consistently positive interactions at the regional
 level varies between 30% and 53%, which is always higher than the percentage
 of similarly defined negative interactions, except for sites in the Mediterrane
an Sea.

Do we agree on the fact that the system is more stable when the max eigen
 value is closer to 0?
\change_inserted -666822487 1546246409
Yes, although in this case it is really to 1 that the numbers should be
 compared – the max eigen value above 1 in module means unstable.
 So the lower, the more stable in the figures.

 Neither the percentage of mutualistic interactions nor the complexity metrics
 did strongly affect the stability properties, although there was perhaps
 a slight decline with the percentage of mutualistic interactions (but it
 may be simply due to an unbalance in this percentage, usually high, in
 the datasets).

 Species that were more self-regulating also had also a higher vulnerability
 score, and those two influences are likely to trade-off: a high degree
 of self-regulation somehow buffers outside influences.
 Species that were less self-regulating were also more likely to have a
 broad range of effects onto other species [to interpret this we may also
 need to check that they were more abundant, if so I would say that species
 varying broadly have a higher likelihood to generate effects in other species]
\change_inserted -2100369821 1546420330

 also increased weakly with abundance; see abundance_vs_regulation.pdf in
 'SI of SI'.

\change_unchanged
.
 It is important to note, however, that these patterns are weak and there
 is therefore a considerable amount of randomness dominating the interaction
 matrix: many scenarios of self-regulation vs limitation by others are therefore
 possible.

 not only plankton studies but also a couple of vertebrate or insect studies
 on smaller (less diverse) communities, where interactions are stronger.
 The conclusion from this comparison seems to be that any diverse system
 of competitors and facilitators has evolved large niche differences making
 intragroup competition much larger in magnitude than intergroup interactions.

 Large niche differences might be due to the ghost of the competition past,
 i.e., competition has occurred in the past, leading to strong selection and
 subsequent evolution leading to progressive niche separation.
 Species have evolved niches that allow them not to compete or to interact
 only weakly (very strong facilitative effects might be likewise destabilizing

 a large impact on the patterns inferred from interaction models.
 Recent combinations of model fitting and removal experiments have shown
 that the model fitting usually underestimate the effect of competitors

 This could occur for instance if species are spatially segregated (at a
 small scale) because each species only exists within a domain where it
 is relatively competitive, while a focal species could spread out if competitor
s were removed.
 This means that a species can be limited by competitors, but act so as
 to minimize competition (a little like avoidance behaviour in animals)
 so that competition is i effect hard to detect when all species are present.
 This would require some fine-scale segregation between phytoplankton species
 at the scale of interactions, i.e., at the microscale.
 At the moment, it is known that turbulence generates inhomogeneities at
 the microscale
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 which multivariate spatial patterns (as in ref.

[Not sure about what I am writing below, some ideas about the resistant

 competition in the pelagic surveys I think – my guess would be that competition
 between the pelagic stage is always weak because of hidden spatial structure,
 and resistant life-stage only adds to this the possibility for

A final possibility relates to stage structure.
 We have so far referred to the pelagic component of the phytoplankton community
, which is what is sampled and analysed here.
 However, many of the organisms followed here have resistance form.
 These resistance forms, that can sink to the sea bottom, can easily be
 remobilized in the water column after storms, which combined to a rise
 in irradiance, can generate blooms.
 This may greatly help coexistence by frequent recolonization in the coastal
 and therefore shallow marine habitats that are considered here, and may
 dampen or even hide the possible effects of competition.

In this study, the number of phytoplankton groups, S, varies between regions
 but we keep the same 2 covariates, i.e.
 water temperature and salinity, that could be measured for all study sites.
 Therefore, the dimension of the dynamical system only depends on the (square
 of the) number of phytoplankton groups we study, which ranges between 7
 (Mediterranean Sea) and 14 (Brittany).
 The smallest system still requires 70 parameters to be estimated if we
 consider all possible interactions between species.
 To reduce this dimensionality and remove unnecessary parameters, we compared
 different `interaction scenarios' based on BIC.

Weighted connectance is a measure of the proportion of realized links, taking
 into account the shape of the flux distribution,while link density measures
 the average proportion and strength of interactions for a given species.
 These metrics are adapted to weighted interaction matrix but cannot accomodate
 for both positive and negative coefficients: we therefore chose to focus
 on the absolute values of these coefficients, which can be linked to their
 strength even though we do not necessarily know the kind of interaction
 it describes
\begin_inset Note Note

Question to myself: are metrics with absolute values, only negative, only
 positive proportional? Related at least? Are the mean intensities related?
 Maybe plot this and add in SI
\change_inserted -2100369821 1546276538
.
 For now, have a look at test_on_coefficient_sign.pdf in graphe; metrics
 are indeed proportional, so links between complexity and stability are
 still true.
 Mean positive effect is stronger than mean negative effect.
 Should we add this in SI?

For now, this is the mean on non-zero values, which means that vulnerability/gen
erality is only computed *within* the interaction modulus - within pennate
 diatoms, etc.
 We would have much lower values -wich I don't mind,- if we took into account
 all the 0 in our sparse matrix (in line with what we do with Fig.4, actually).
 Should we keep it this way, or should we use the whole interaction matrix
 every time? +I'll add the formula when we settle on the right one.

 Authors usually reported only coefficients that were significant at the

 We therefore computed the mean interspecific interactions as either the

 We should nevertheless mention two biases in this comparison: low-dimension
 matrices tended to be more complete (less sparse) than high-dimension matrices

 The number of parameters to estimate increase as the square of the number
 of interacting groups, leading authors to reduce this set before the estimation
 process.
 While we based our model choice on phylogeny (see above), the typical method
 used by authors to reduce the number of estimated parameters was
