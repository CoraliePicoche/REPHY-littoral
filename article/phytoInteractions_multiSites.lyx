\begin_layout Title
Strong self-regulation and widespread facilitative interactions between
 groups of phytoplankton
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The persistence of phytoplanktonic diversity in spite of competition for
 basic resources has long been a source of wonder and inspiration to ecologists.
 To sort out, among the many coexistence mechanisms suggested by theory
 and experiments, which ones actually maintain diversity in natural ecosystems,
 long-term field studies are paramount.
 Here, we analyze a large dataset of phytoplankton abundance time series,
 counted every two weeks over 20 years, at 10 sites along the French coastline.
 We estimate biotic interactions using dynamic, multispecies autoregressive
 models.
 We show that a strong self-regulation, with intraspecific competition strength
 an order of magnitude higher than interspecific, was 
\change_deleted -666822487 1549802891
a key feature of
\change_inserted -666822487 1549802893
present in all 
\change_deleted -666822487 1549802892
 
\change_unchanged
phytoplanktonic interaction networks.
 Furthermore, positive net effects between phytoplanktonic taxa constituted
 at least 40% of non-null interactions in all sites.
 Both strong self-regulation and widespread net facilitation should therefore
 be key features of coexistence mechanisms 
\change_deleted -666822487 1549802837

\change_inserted -666822487 1549802839

 to explain phytoplankton diversity maintenance.

How species or related genera can coexist together in spite of likely competitio

 Many theoretical studies of competition models have shown that competitive

However, the evidence gathered from 
\change_inserted -666822487 1549802934
terrestrial

 processes may be paramount, with intraspecific competition dwarfing interspecif

 Those two influences are likely to trade-off: a high degree of self-regulation
 somehow buffers outside influences.
 Species that were less self-regulating
\change_inserted -666822487 1549805178

 As these species tended to be more abundant (Supplementary Fig.

 Large niche differences might be due to the ghost of the competition past,
 i.e., competition has occurred in the past, leading to strong selection and
 subsequent evolution leading to progressive niche separation.
 Species have evolved niches that allow them not to compete or to interact
 only weakly (very strong facilitative effects might be likewise destabilizing
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand supercite

 The likely predator effects that we highlighted above could be comprised
 within such niche differentiation sensu largo: specialized predators can

 This could occur for instance if species are spatially segregated (at a
 small scale) because each species only exists within a domain where it
 is relatively competitive, while a focal species could spread out if competitor
s were removed.
 This means that a species can be limited by competitors, but act so as
 to minimize competition (a little like avoidance behaviour in animals)
 so that competition is in effect hard to detect when all species are present.
 This would require some fine-scale segregation between phytoplankton species
 at the scale of interactions, i.e., at the microscale.
 At the moment, it is known that turbulence generates inhomogeneities at
 the microscale

A final possibility relates to stage structure.
 We have so far referred to the pelagic component of the phytoplankton community
, which is what is sampled and analysed here.
 However, many of the organisms followed here have resistance form.
 These resistance forms, that can sink to the sea bottom, can easily be
 remobilized in the water column after storms, which combined to a rise
 in irradiance, can generate blooms.
 This may greatly help coexistence by frequent recolonization in the coastal
 and therefore shallow marine habitats that are considered here, and may
 dampen or even hide the possible effects of competition.

 Because temperature and salinity sum up seasonal changes in light as well

In this study, the number of phytoplankton groups, S, varies between regions
 but we keep the same 2 covariates, i.e.
 water temperature and salinity, that could be measured for all study sites.
 Therefore, the dimension of the dynamical system only depends on the (square
 of the) number of phytoplankton groups we study, which ranges between 7
 (Mediterranean Sea) and 14 (Brittany).
 The smallest system still requires 70 parameters to be estimated if we
 consider all possible interactions between species.
 To reduce this dimensionality and remove unnecessary parameters, we compared
 different `interaction scenarios' based on BIC.

 Weighted connectance is a measure of the proportion of realized links,

 measures the average proportion and strength of interactions for a given

 These metrics are adapted to weighted interaction matri

 Maybe plot this and add in SI

 For now, have a look at test_on_coefficient_sign.pdf in graphe; metrics
 are indeed proportional, so links between complexity and stability are
 still true.
 Mean positive effect is stronger than mean negative effect.

 Raw values indicate the average effect (i.e., is the effect mostly positive

 There is therefore a positive correlation between sparsity and dimensionality

 The number of parameters to estimate increase as the square of the number
 of interacting groups, leading authors to reduce this set before the estimation
 process.

I'm wondering if the last two caveats that we mention are not something

 We can discuss this.
