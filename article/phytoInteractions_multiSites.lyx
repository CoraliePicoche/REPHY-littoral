\begin_layout Abstract
The persistence of phytoplanktonic diversity in spite of competition for
 basic resources has long been a source of wonder and inspiration to ecologists.
 To sort out, among the many coexistence mechanisms suggested by theory
 and experiments, which ones actually maintain diversity in natural ecosystems,
 long-term field studies are paramount.
 Here, we analyze a large dataset of phytoplankton abundance time series,
 counted every two weeks over 20 years, at 10 sites along the French coastline.
 We estimate biotic interactions using dynamic, multispecies autoregressive
 models.
 We show that a strong self-regulation, with intraspecific competition strength
 an order of magnitude higher than interspecific, was present in all phytoplankt
onic interaction networks.
 Furthermore, positive net effects between phytoplanktonic taxa constituted
 at least 40% of non-null interactions in all sites.
 Both strong self-regulation and widespread net facilitation should therefore
 be key features of coexistence mechanisms intending to explain phytoplankton
 diversity maintenance.

 This led to sparse, modular matrices that have two main features.
 First, we observe a strong self-regulation for all sites (Fig.

.
 The ratio of mean intragenus to intergenus interaction coefficients varied
 between 6 and 10, not counting coefficients set to 0 in the estimation
 process.
 If we include the zeroes in the interaction matrix in the computation of
 the intra/inter mean interaction strength, the ratio rises to between 21
 and 43.
 Therefore, intragenus interactions are on average much stronger than intergenus
 interactions
\change_inserted -666822487 1550250674

Second, although the percentage of facilitative interactions seemed to vary
 among sites (between 40% and 71% of interactions in the selected models),
 facilitation remained predominant in 9 sites out of 10 (only Lazaret, in
 the Mediterranean Sea, has 60% negative interactions).
 Our observational setup being nested, with sites within regions, we can
 examine whether locally positive interactions remain positive in a regional
 context: the percentage of consistently positive interactions at the regional
 level varies between 30% and 53%, higher than the percentage of similarly
 defined negative interactions (between 15% and 40%), except for sites in
 the Mediterranean Sea.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have found that the percentage of true mutualism (+/+) is substantial:
 averaged over all sites, 32% of all interactions are (+/+) while only 12%
 of them are (-/-).
 The sign correspondence is not always maintained between French regions:
 the only interaction that is non-zero in the 10 sites (CHA/SKE) is mutualistic
 in Men er Roue only (Brittany) and mixed (+/-) at all other sites.
 Within the same region, however, interactions measured at different sites
 tend to keep the same sign.
 In the 3 sites of Marennes-Oléron, for instance, there were 4 interactions
 which remained positive on both sides (CHA/GUI, DIT/GUI, LEP/THP, SKE/THP),
 3 of them being also mutualistic in some of the Brittany sites.
 This contradicts previous observations that mutualistic interactions tend
 to be more context-dependent than competitive interactions

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

): species that were more self-regulating also had also a higher vulnerability
 score and a lower impact score.
 Those two influences are likely to trade-off: a high degree of self-regulation
 somehow buffers outside influences.
 Species that were less self-regulating were also more likely to have a
 broad range of effects onto other species.
 As these species tended to be more abundant (Supplementary Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 It is important to note, however, that these trends are weak and there
 is therefore a considerable amount of randomness dominating the interaction
 matrix: many scenarios of self-regulation vs limitation by others are therefore
 possible.

Relation between vulnerability/impact and self-regulation.

\series default
 Average vulnerability (effects of others onto the focal species growth
 rate, a-b) and impact (effects of the focal species unto other's growth
 rates, c-d), as well as self-regulation, are computed for untransformed
 (a-c) or absolute (b-d) values of the coefficients of the interaction matrix

 niche differences between the species/genera, translating into much higher
 intragroup than intergroup effects on growth rates, together with a high

Finally, we sought to put these results in a broader context by compiling

 count data (listed in Supplementary Table

 We found that the order of magnitude of intra/inter interaction strengths
 considered here is not particularly above those found for most planktonic
 systems to which MAR(1) models have been fitted, considering that our systems
 are relatively high-dimensional and that the higher the dimension, the
 larger the intraspecific regulation

 not only plankton studies but also a couple of vertebrate or insect studies
 on less diverse communities, where interactions are stronger.
 The conclusion from this comparison seems to be that any diverse system
 of competitors and facilitators has evolved large niche differences making
 intragroup competition much larger in magnitude than intergroup interactions.

 Large niche differences might be due to the ghost of the competition past,
 i.e., competition has occurred in the past, leading to strong selection and
 subsequent evolution leading to progressive niche separation.
 Species have evolved niches that allow them not to compete or to interact
 only weakly (very strong facilitative effects might be likewise destabilizing
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand supercite
key "coyte_ecology_2015"

 The likely predator effects that we highlighted above could be comprised
 within such niche differentiation sensu largo: specialized predators can
 make strong conspecific density-dependence emerge

 a large impact on the patterns inferred from interaction models.
 Recent combinations of model fitting and removal experiments have shown
 that the model fitting usually underestimate the effect of competitors
 that are uncovered by removal experiments

 This could occur for instance if species are spatially segregated (at a
 small scale) because each species only exists within a domain where it
 is relatively competitive, while a focal species could spread out if competitor
s were removed.
 This means that a species can be limited by competitors, but act so as
 to minimize competition (a little like avoidance behaviour in animals)
 so that competition is in effect hard to detect when all species are present.
 This would require some fine-scale segregation between phytoplankton species
 at the scale of interactions, i.e., at the microscale.
 At the moment, it is known that turbulence generates inhomogeneities at
 the microscale
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand supercite
key "barton_impact_2014,breier_emergence_2018"

 Also, even if turbulence generates spatial structure with segregation between
 species, it is not quite clear that the

 mechanism could work for plancton, because turbulence rather than organism

[Not sure about what I am writing below, some ideas about the resistant

 media but a stage structure, we would still expect to see some degree of
 competition in the pelagic surveys I think – my guess would be that competition
 between the pelagic stage is always weak because of hidden spatial structure,
 and resistant life-stage only adds to this the possibility for

A final possibility relates to stage structure.
 We have so far referred to the pelagic component of the phytoplankton community
, which is what is sampled and analysed here.
 However, many of the organisms followed here have resistance form.
 These resistance forms, that can sink to the sea bottom, can easily be
 remobilized in the water column after storms, which combined to a rise
 in irradiance, can generate blooms.
 This may greatly help coexistence by frequent recolonization in the coastal
 and therefore shallow marine habitats that are considered here, and may
 dampen or even hide the possible effects of competition.

 Since 1987, this monitoring program has required 26 sites along the French

Covariables included nutrients and hydrodynamics variables, and the latter
 were found more influential; nutrient dynamics contributed little to phytoplank
ton dynamics on the two-weeks timescale.
 Because temperature and salinity sum up seasonal changes in light as well
 as hydrology (salinity is inversely related to freshwater inflow), these
 represent the two key drivers needed to account for abiotic influences

 was complemented by that of phytoplankton-like simulated data, which confirmed
 the ability of MAR(1) models to infer biotic interactions and abiotic forcing
 (e.g., no need for extra non-linearities to model the storage effect, which
 was found to be nearly non-existent, as in previous analyses of plant data
 for which strong-self regulation was observed

 Furthermore, using two abiotic variables (temperature and salinity) in
 this study rather than the full set of used in Barraquand et al.

 led to almost identical estimates to the ones obtained previously

 We are therefore confident that the MAR(1) models presented here are robust
 to small changes in model specification.
 In general, MAR(1) models tend to be fairly robust to small deviations
 of the underlying (non-linear) data-generating model, provided that one
 asks mainly order of magnitude of coefficients values (rather than precise
 estimates) and sign of interaction coefficients

In this study, the number of phytoplankton groups, S, varies between regions
 but we keep the same 2 covariates, i.e.
 water temperature and salinity, that could be measured for all study sites.
 Therefore, the dimension of the dynamical system only depends on the (square
 of the) number of phytoplankton groups we study, which ranges between 7
 (Mediterranean Sea) and 14 (Brittany).
 The smallest system still requires 70 parameters to be estimated if we
 consider all possible interactions between species.
 To reduce this dimensionality and remove unnecessary parameters, we compared
 different `interaction scenarios' based on BIC.
 The null interaction scenario assumed no interaction between groups of
 species (diagonal interaction matrix) and was compared to four other interactio
n scenarios.
 The first interaction scenario assumed that interactions could only occur
 between phylogenetically close organisms, i.e., within a class (namely, diatoms,
 dinoflagellates, and other phytoplanktonic organisms) while the second
 interaction scenario further differentiated pennate and centric diatoms.
 The third interaction scenario considered the inverse hypothesis, that
 only unrelated organisms could interact (i.e., a diatom could only interact
 with a dinoflagellate or a cryptophyte, but not with another diatom), and
 the last interaction scenario did not constrain the interactions at all
 (full interaction matrix).

\change_inserted -2100369821 1549978575
 The second interaction scenario, hereafter called the pennate-centric scenario,
 had the lowest BIC for all sites and was therefore the most accurate while
 still parsimonious: we chose to further investigate the corresponding networks.

Analysis of interaction strengths

The interaction matrix obtained from MAR(1) analyses can be used to determine
 the stability of a discrete-time dynamical system
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

key "ives_estimating_2003"

\end_inset

.
 We compared the maximum modulus of the eigenvalues of the pennate/centric
 matrices in each site, as a proxy of stability, to network metrics which
 could be related to complexity, such as weighted connectance and linkage
 density
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand supercite
key "breier_emergence_2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Weighted connectance is a measure of the proportion of realized links,
 taking into account the shape of the flux distribution,while link density
 measures the average proportion and strength of interactions for a given
 species.
 These metrics are adapted to weighted interaction matrices but cannot accomodat
e for both positive and negative coefficients: we therefore chose to focus
 on the absolute values of these coefficients, which can be linked to their
 strength, irrespective of interaction sign.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to these network-level metrics, we also computed the average
 vulnerability (average effect of other taxa on a focal taxon, Supplementary
 Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "eq:vulnerability"
plural "false"

 Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "eq:impact"
plural "false"

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) on both raw and absolute values of the coefficients,and compared these
 to the regulation a focal species exerted on itself.
 Raw values indicate the average effect (i.e., is the effect mostly positive
 or negative?) that can be expected on a species' growth rate from other
 planktonic species while absolute effects characterize the strength of
 all types of interactions on a species (i.e., is a species strongly affected
 by the others?).

 Authors usually reported only coefficients that were significant at the
 95% threshold, ignoring potentially many weak effects.
 We therefore computed both the mean value of all coefficients outside of
 the matrix diagonal, replacing missing values by 0 (Fig.

 The number of parameters to estimate increase as the square of the number
 of interacting groups, leading authors to reduce this set before the estimation
