\begin_layout Abstract
The persistence of phytoplanktonic diversity in spite of competition for
 basic resources has long been a source of wonder and inspiration to ecologists.
 To sort out, among the many coexistence mechanisms suggested by theory
 and experiments, which ones actually maintain diversity in natural ecosystems,
 long-term field studies are paramount.
 Here, we analyze a large dataset of phytoplankton abundance time series,
 counted every two weeks over 20 years, at 10 sites along the French coastline.
 We estimate biotic interactions using dynamic, multispecies autoregressive
 models.
 We show that a strong self-regulation, with

, was present in all phytoplanktonic interaction networks.
 Furthermore, positive net effects between phytoplanktonic taxa constituted
 at least 40% of non-null interactions in all sites.
 Both strong self-regulation and widespread net facilitation should therefore
 be key features of coexistence mechanisms intending to explain phytoplankton
 diversity maintenance.

 to suggest that, in fact, niche rather than neutral processes may be paramount
 to explain coexistence, with intraspecific competition dwarfing interspecific

 Best-fitting models corresponded to a phylogenetically-structured interaction
 scenario, where interaction only occurred betwen closely related genera
 (Supplementary Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Comparison-of-BIC"
plural "false"
caps "false"

\end_inset

).
 This led to sparse, modular matrices that have two main features.
 First, we observe a strong self-regulation for all sites (Fig.

 highlighted in a more detailed analysis on one of the considered study
 regions

\end_inset

.
 The ratio of mean intragenus to intergenus interaction coefficients varied
 between 6 and 10, not counting coefficients set to 0 in the estimation
 process.
 If we include the zeroes in the interaction matrix in the computation of
 the intra/inter mean interaction strength, the ratio rises to between 21
 and 43.
 Therefore, intragenus interactions are on average much stronger than intergenus
 interactions, approximately 10 to 20 times stronger.

Second, although the percentage of facilitative interactions seemed to vary
 among sites (between 40% and 71% of interactions in the selected models),
 facilitation remained predominant in 9 sites out of 10 (only Lazaret, in
 the Mediterranean Sea, has 60% negative interactions).
 Our observational setup being nested, with sites within regions, we can
 examine whether locally positive interactions remain positive in a regional
 context: the percentage of consistently positive interactions at the regional
 level varies between 30% and 53%, higher than the percentage of similarly
 defined negative interactions (between 15% and 40%), except for sites in
 the Mediterranean Sea.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have found that the percentage of true mutualism (+/+) is substantial:
 averaged over all sites, 32% of all interactions are (+/+) while only 12%
 of them are (-/-).
 The sign correspondence is not always maintained between French regions:
 the only interaction that is non-zero in the 10 sites (CHA/SKE) is mutualistic
 in Men er Roue only (Brittany) and mixed (+/-) at all other sites.
 Within the same region, however, interactions measured at different sites
 tend to keep the same sign.
 In the 3 sites of Marennes-Oléron, for instance, there were 4 interactions
 which remained positive on both sides (CHA/GUI, DIT/GUI, LEP/THP, SKE/THP),
 3 of them being also mutualistic in some of the Brittany sites.
 This contradicts previous observations that mutualistic interactions tend
 to be more context-dependent than competitive interactions

I am wondering if we do not overinterpret a little here: how sure are we
 about this? Because most of the interactions are between centric diatoms,
 so could it be a sampling effect? Or, would this still be true if we took
 a matrix with more entries and less zeroes? [Nothing necessarily to change
 here, but something to discuss between us]

 Interactions that are consistent at the regional level, for other phyla

The rather high intra/intertaxon interaction strength ratio
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 that we found, from 5 to 20, depending on how one counts the interactions
 set to zero in the estimation process, could appear extremely high in light
 of previous intra/interspecific competition strength estimates of 4 to
 5 by Adler et al.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 This requires some explanation.
 First, one could argue that such high intra/inter ratio arises because
 we consider the genus as our baseline taxonomic unit, rather than the species.
 Although it is logical that niche differentiation increases as one gets
 up the phylogenetic tree, and that getting down to the species level could
 decrease slightly that ratio, there are two good arguments suggesting that
 the niche differences found here extend to the species level.
 First, species belonging to the various genera considered here are often
 found to compete in experiments

 There is therefore a massive difference between niches in the lab and in

Another main finding of our study is the large frequency of facilitative
 interactions, between 40 and 70%, with 30% truly mutualistic (+/+) interactions.
 This again can be compared to the meta-analysis by Adler et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand supercite

 who found facilitative interactions, but with a flower faction (

30%).
 However, Adler et al.

's review contain many experiments while the plant literature is replete
 with field examples of facilitation

LatexCommand supercite

\end_inset

, so that facilitation could be much higher in the field.
 We note that several authors using MAR(1) models previously forbade positive
 interactions within the same trophic level, so that the fraction of facilitativ
e interactions in phytoplankton cannot be computed from literature-derived
 MAR(1) estimates.
 At the moment, it is therefore unknown how the predominance of facilitative
 interactions that we found in phytoplankton compares to facilitation in
 terrestrial plants.

However, it was more difficult to explain the reverse link: a genus that
 is more self-regulated and rarer was found here to be on average more vulnerabl
e to other genera's increases in densities.
 Such relation implies greater stability for the network as a whole, because
 the taxon the most vulnerable to other taxa's impacts are also those that
 are the most self-regulated and whose dynamics are therefore less perturbed.
 By which mechanisms this could happen is so far unclear and open to speculation.
 We caution, however, that the relationships between vulnerability, impact
 and self-regulation that we evidenced are all relatively weak: considerable
 stochasticity dominates the distribution of interaction matrix coefficients.

 Recent combinations of model fitting and removal experiments have shown

 This could occur for instance if species are spatially segregated (at a
 small scale) because each species only exists within a domain where it
 is relatively competitive, while a focal species could spread out if competitor
s were removed.
 This means that a species can be limited by competitors, but act so as
 to minimize competition (a little like avoidance behaviour in animals)
 so that competition is in effect hard to detect when all species are present.
 This would require some fine-scale segregation between phytoplankton species
 at the scale of interactions, i.e., at the microscale.
 At the moment, it is known that turbulence generates inhomogeneities at
 the microscale

 Also, even if turbulence generates spatial structure with segregation between

[Not sure about what I am writing below, some ideas about the resistant

 competition in the pelagic surveys I think – my guess would be that competition
 between the pelagic stage is always weak because of hidden spatial structure,
 and resistant life-stage only adds to this the possibility for

A final possibility relates to stage structure.
 We have so far referred to the pelagic component of the phytoplankton community
, which is what is sampled and analysed here.
 However, many of the organisms followed here have resistance form.
 These resistance forms, that can sink to the sea bottom, can easily be
 remobilized in the water column after storms, which combined to a rise
 in irradiance, can generate blooms.
 This may greatly help coexistence by frequent recolonization in the coastal
 and therefore shallow marine habitats that are considered here, and may
 dampen or even hide the possible effects of competition.

 Since 1987, this monitoring program has required 26 sites along the French
 coastline to be sampled every 2 weeks within 2 hours of high tide to determine
 both biotic (phytoplankton counts) and abiotic (water temperature, salinity)
 parameters.
 We focused on sites

\change_deleted -2100369821 1549966224
that had been sampled at least 10 years after 1996.

 We also excluded time series which had missing data for over 6 months or
 an average delay between sampling dates above 20 days.
 This reduced the number of study sites to 10 sites nested within 4 regions

 Because temperature and salinity sum up seasonal changes in light as well
 as hydrology (salinity is inversely related to freshwater inflow), these

 the ability of MAR(1) models to infer biotic interactions and abiotic forcing
 (e.g., no need for extra non-linearities to model the storage effect, which
 was found to be nearly non-existent, as in previous analyses of plant data
 for which strong-self regulation was observed

 In general, MAR(1) models tend to be fairly robust to small deviations

 estimates) and sign of interaction coefficients

In this study, the number of phytoplankton groups, S, varies between regions
 but we keep the same 2 covariates, i.e.
 water temperature and salinity, that could be measured for all study sites.
 Therefore, the dimension of the dynamical system only depends on the (square
 of the) number of phytoplankton groups we study, which ranges between 7
 (Mediterranean Sea) and 14 (Brittany).
 The smallest system still requires 70 parameters to be estimated if we
 consider all possible interactions between species.
 To reduce this dimensionality and remove unnecessary parameters, we compared
 different `interaction scenarios' based on BIC.
 The null interaction scenario assumed no interaction between groups of
 species (diagonal interaction matrix) and was compared to four other interactio
n scenarios.
 The first interaction scenario assumed that interactions could only occur
 between phylogenetically close organisms, i.e., within a class (namely, diatoms,
 dinoflagellates, and other phytoplanktonic organisms) while the second
 interaction scenario further differentiated pennate and centric diatoms.
 The third interaction scenario considered the inverse hypothesis, that
 only unrelated organisms could interact (i.e., a diatom could only interact
 with a dinoflagellate or a cryptophyte, but not with another diatom), and
 the last interaction scenario did not constrain the interactions at all
 (full interaction matrix).
 The second interaction scenario, hereafter called the pennate-centric scenario,
 had the lowest BIC for all sites and was therefore the most accurate while
 still parsimonious: we chose to further investigate the corresponding networks.

Analysis of interaction strengths

The interaction matrix obtained from MAR(1) analyses can be used to determine
 the stability of a discrete-time dynamical system
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand supercite
key "ives_estimating_2003"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 We compared the maximum modulus of the eigenvalues of the pennate/centric
 matrices in each site, as a proxy of stability, to network metrics which
 could be related to complexity, such as weighted connectance and linkage
 density
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand supercite
key "breier_emergence_2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Weighted connectance is a measure of the proportion of realized links,
 taking into account the shape of the flux distribution,while link density
 measures the average proportion and strength of interactions for a given
 species.
 These metrics are adapted to weighted interaction matrices but cannot accomodat
e for both positive and negative coefficients: we therefore chose to focus
 on the absolute values of these coefficients, which can be linked to their
 strength, irrespective of interaction sign.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to these network-level metrics, we also computed the average
 vulnerability (average effect of other taxa on a focal taxon, Supplementary
 Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Eq.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

noprefix "false"

\end_inset

) on both raw and absolute values of the coefficients,and compared these
 to the regulation a focal species exerted on itself.
 Raw values indicate the average effect (i.e., is the effect mostly positive
 or negative?) that can be expected on a species' growth rate from other
 planktonic species while absolute effects characterize the strength of
 all types of interactions on a species (i.e., is a species strongly affected
 by the others?).
