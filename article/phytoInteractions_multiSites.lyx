Strong self-regulation and widespread facilitative interactions between
 genera of phytoplankton

\begin_layout Abstract
The persistence of phytoplanktonic diversity in spite of competition for
 basic resources has long been a source of wonder and inspiration to ecologists.
 To sort out, among the many coexistence mechanisms suggested by theory
 and experiments, which ones actually maintain diversity in natural ecosystems,
 long-term field studies are paramount.
 Here, we analy

e a large dataset of phytoplankton abundance time series, counted every
 two weeks over 20 years, at 10 sites along the French coastline.
 We estimate biotic interactions using dynamic, multispecies autoregressive
 models.
 We show that a strong self-regulation, with competition strength within
 a genus an order of magnitude higher than between genera, was present in
 all phytoplanktonic interaction networks.
 Furthermore, positive net effects between phytoplanktonic taxa constituted
 at least 40% of non-null interactions in all sites.
 Both strong self-regulation and widespread net facilitation should therefore
 be key features of coexistence mechanisms intending to explain phytoplankton
 diversity maintenance.

How species or close genera can coexist together in spite of competition
 is one of the main puzzles of community ecology, especially for primary
 producers that seemingly share the same basic resources

 Many theoretical studies of competition models have shown that competitive
 exclusion is likely in those circumstances

\begin_layout Standard
However, the evidence gathered from terrestrial plant communities starts
 to suggest that, in fact, niche rather than neutral processes may be paramount
 to explain coexistence, with intraspecific competition dwarfing interspecific
 competition in most cases

 Whether these conclusions drawn from studies of annual plants and forest
 trees apply to other ecosystems and taxa is currently little known (but

Moreover, even within a single trophic level, competition may not be the
 rule: the meta-analysis by Adler et al.

 usually tend to think.
 Although some theoretical studies suggest that facilitative interactions

Using MAR(1) autoregressive models, we have produced interaction matrices

 – i.e., Jacobian community matrices on the logarithmic scale

 Best-fitting models corresponded to a phylogenetically-structured interaction
 scenario, where interaction only occurred betwen closely related genera
 (Supplementary Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

).
 This led to sparse, modular matrices that have two main features.
 First, we observe a strong self-regulation for all sites (Fig.

 If we include the zeroes in the interaction matrix in the computation of

 Therefore, intragenus interactions are on average much stronger than intergenus

Second, although the percentage of facilitative interactions seemed to vary
 among sites (between 40% and 71% of interactions in the selected models),
 facilitation remained predominant in 9 sites out of 10 (only Lazaret, in
 the Mediterranean Sea, has 60% negative interactions).
 Our observational setup being nested, with sites within regions, we can
 examine whether locally positive interactions remain positive in a regional
 context: the percentage of consistently positive interactions at the regional
 level varies between 30% and 53%, higher than the percentage of similarly
 defined negative interactions (between 15% and 40%), except for sites in
 the Mediterranean Sea.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have found that the percentage of true mutualism (+/+) is substantial:
 averaged over all sites, 32% of all interactions are (+/+) while only 12%
 of them are (-/-).
 The sign correspondence is not always maintained between French regions:
 the only interaction that is non-zero in the 10 sites (CHA/SKE) is mutualistic
 in Men er Roue only (Brittany) and mixed (+/-) at all other sites.
 Within the same region, however, interactions measured at different sites
 tend to keep the same sign.
 In the 3 sites of Marennes-Oléron, for instance, there were 4 interactions
 which remained positive on both sides (CHA/GUI, DIT/GUI, LEP/THP, SKE/THP),
 3 of them being also mutualistic in some of the Brittany sites.
 This contradicts previous observations that mutualistic interactions tend
 to be more context-dependent than competitive interactions

I am wondering if we do not overinterpret a little here: how sure are we
 about this? [Consistent mutualistic interactions only between centric diatoms]
 Because most of the interactions are between centric diatoms, so could
 it be a sampling effect? Or, would this still be true if we took a matrix
 with more entries and less zeroes? [Nothing necessarily to change here,
 but something to discuss between us] Yes, I thought about it too.
 Leaving that here, we can either tone it down or just leave it out.

): genera that were more self-regulating also had also a higher vulnerability
 score and a lower impact score.
 Those two influences are likely to trade-off: a high degree of self-regulation
 somehow buffers outside influences.
 Taxa that were less self-regulating were also more likely to have a broad
 range of effects onto other taxa.
 As these genera tended to be more abundant (Supplementary Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 It is important to note, however, that these trends are weak and there
 is therefore a considerable amount of randomness dominating the interaction
 matrix: many scenarios of self-regulation vs limitation by others are therefore
 possible.

This requires some explanation.
 First, one could argue that such high intra/inter ratio arises because
 we consider the genus as our baseline taxonomic unit, rather than the species.
 Although it is logical that niche differentiation increases as one gets
 up the phylogenetic tree, and that getting down to the species level could
 decrease slightly that ratio, there are two good arguments suggesting that
 the niche differences found here extend to the species level.
 First, species belonging to the various genera considered here are often
 found to compete in experiments

 There is therefore a massive difference between niches in the lab and in
 the field

.
 Second,the only other study that managed to provide MAR(1) estimates down
 to the species level for phytoplankton, that of Huber and Gaedke
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand supercite

\begin_inset CommandInset ref

 Strong self-regulation seems therefore a genuine feature of field phytoplankton
ic communities.

Another main finding of our study is the large frequency of facilitative
 interactions, between 40 and 70%, with 30% truly mutualistic (+/+) interactions.

, so that facilitation could be much higher in the field.
 We note that several authors using MAR(1) models previously forbade positive
 interactions within the same trophic level, so that the fraction of facilitativ
e interactions in phytoplankton cannot be computed from literature-derived
 MAR(1) estimates.
 At the moment, it is therefore unknown how the predominance of facilitative
 interactions that we found in phytoplankton compares to facilitation in
 terrestrial plants.

 that the new study regions (Oléron, Brittanny, Mediterranean) have similar

 Though natural enemies are good candidates to explain the observed niche

There was no relation between the complexity of the communities (measured
 as either the weighted connectance or linkage density of the interaction
 matrices) and their stability, as measured by the dominant eigenvalue of
 the interaction matrix, which measures the return time to a point equilibrium.
 This result is conditional upon our model being a good approximate description
 of the system (i.e., no multiyear limit cycles or chaotic attractors as the
 mapping between eigenvalues and actual stability is distorted in that case

 We also found that the percentage of mutualistic interactions, that is
 thought to affect the stability of the network
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand supercite
key "mougi2012diversity,coyte_ecology_2015,garcia-callejas_multiple_2018"

, does not have a major impact on the network's resilience.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to weighted connectance, indices at the network-level (e.g., linkage
 density) and at the species or genus level (vulnerability and impact) approxima
te the average effects exerted and sustained by any given taxa in the different
 study sites.
 While, at the network level, network structure (either complexity measures
 or the percentage of mutualistic interactions) did not affect stability,
 a relation emerged between self-regulation, necessary for coexistence,
 and genus-level indices.
 We found that the more a genus is self-regulated, the more it tends to
 be vulnerable to other genera impacts and the less it impacts other genera.
 High self-regulation usually indicates large niche differences with the
 rest of the community, and it makes therefore sense that a species/genus
 whose needs strongly differ from the others only marginally impacts the
 resources of the other coexisting species.
 Furthermore, a low self-regulation was correlated with strong average abundance
, which echoes findings by Yenni et al.
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand supercite
key "yenni_persistent_2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 who found that rare species usually show stronger self-regulation.
 This correlation between rarity and self-regulation could explain the lesser
 impact effect of high self-regulated species/genus: a species which dominate
 the community composition can have a major effect on the others, especially
 as they usually cover more space, while it is harder for rare, localized
 species have large impacts.
 However, it was more difficult to explain the reverse link: a genus that
 is more self-regulated and rarer was found here to be on average more vulnerabl
e to other genera's increases in densities.
 Such relation implies greater stability for the network as a whole, because
 the

\change_deleted -2100369821 1551798415
 
\change_unchanged
the most vulnerable to other taxa's impacts are also those that are the
 most self-regulated and whose dynamics are therefore less perturbed.
 By which mechanisms this could happen is so far unclear and open to speculation.
 We caution, however, that the relationships between vulnerability, impact
 and self-regulation that we evidenced are all relatively weak: considerable
 stochasticity dominates the distribution of interaction matrix coefficients.

 Large niche differences might be due to the ghost of the competition past,
 i.e., competition has occurred in the past, leading to strong selection and
 subsequent evolution leading to progressive niche separation.
 In this scenario, species have evolved niches that allow them not to compete
 or to interact only weakly (very strong facilitative effects might be likewise
 destabilizing

 might have a large impact on the patterns inferred from temporal interaction
 models such as ours.

 This could occur for instance if species are spatially segregated (at a
 small scale) because each species only exists within a domain where it
 is relatively competitive, while a focal species could spread out if competitor
s were removed.
 This means that a species can be limited by competitors, but act so as
 to minimize competition (a little like avoidance behaviour in animals)
 so that competition is in effect hard to detect when all species are present.
 This would require some fine-scale segregation between phytoplankton species
 at the scale of interactions, i.e., at the microscale.
 At the moment, it is known that turbulence generates inhomogeneities at
 the microscale

A final possibility relates to stage structure.
 We have so far referred to the pelagic component of the phytoplankton community
, which is what is sampled and analysed here.
 However, many of the organisms followed here have resistance form.
 These resistance forms, that can sink to the sea bottom, can easily be
 remobilized in the water column after storms, which combined to a rise
 in irradiance, can generate blooms.
 This may greatly help coexistence by frequent recolonization in the coastal
 and therefore shallow marine habitats that are considered here, and may
 dampen or even hide the possible effects of competition.

 Since 1987, this monitoring program has required 26 sites along the French
 coastline to be sampled every 2 weeks within 2 hours of high tide to determine
 both biotic (phytoplankton counts) and abiotic (water temperature, salinity)
 parameters.
 We focused on sites which had the longest and most recent time series.
 We also excluded time series which had missing data for over 6 months or
 an average delay between sampling dates above 20 days.
 This reduced the number of study sites to 10 sites nested within 4 regions

In this study, the number of phytoplankton groups, S, varies between regions
 but we keep the same 2 covariates, i.e.
 water temperature and salinity, that could be measured for all study sites.
 Therefore, the dimension of the dynamical system only depends on the (square
 of the) number of phytoplankton groups we study, which ranges between 7
 (Mediterranean Sea) and 14 (Brittany).
 The smallest system still requires 70 parameters to be estimated if we
 consider all possible interactions between species.
 To reduce this dimensionality and remove unnecessary parameters, we compared
 different `interaction scenarios' based on BIC.
 The null interaction scenario assumed no interaction between groups of
 species (diagonal interaction matrix) and was compared to four other interactio
n scenarios.
 The first interaction scenario assumed that interactions could only occur
 between phylogenetically close organisms, i.e., within a class (namely, diatoms,
 dinoflagellates, and other phytoplanktonic organisms) while the second
 interaction scenario further differentiated pennate and centric diatoms.
 The third interaction scenario considered the inverse hypothesis, that
 only unrelated organisms could interact (i.e., a diatom could only interact
 with a dinoflagellate or a cryptophyte, but not with another diatom), and
 the last interaction scenario did not constrain the interactions at all
 (full interaction matrix).
 The second interaction scenario, hereafter called the pennate-centric scenario,
 had the lowest BIC for all sites and was therefore the most accurate while
 still parsimonious: we chose to further investigate the corresponding networks.

The interaction matrix obtained from MAR(1) analyses can be used to determine
 the stability of a discrete-time dynamical system

.
 We compared the maximum modulus of the eigenvalues of the pennate/centric
 matrices in each site, as a proxy of stability, to network metrics which
 could be related to complexity, such as weighted connectance and linkage
 density
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand supercite
key "breier_emergence_2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Weighted connectance is a measure of the proportion of realized links,
 taking into account the shape of the flux distribution,while link density
 measures the average proportion and strength of interactions for a given
 species.
 These metrics are adapted to weighted interaction matrices but cannot accomodat
e for both positive and negative coefficients: we therefore chose to focus
 on the absolute values of these coefficients, which can be linked to their
 strength, irrespective of interaction sign.

\begin_layout Standard
In addition to these network-level metrics, we also computed the average
 vulnerability (average effect of other taxa on a focal taxon, Supplementary
 Eq.

) on both raw and absolute values of the coefficients,and compared these
 to the regulation a focal species exerted on itself.
 Raw values indicate the average effect (i.e., is the effect mostly positive
 or negative?) that can be expected on a species' growth rate from other
 planktonic species while absolute effects characteri

 Authors usually reported only coefficients that were significant at the
 95% threshold, ignoring potentially many weak effects.
 We therefore computed both the mean value of all coefficients outside of
 the matrix diagonal, replacing missing values by 0 (Fig.

 value of statistically significant coefficients only (Supplementary Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref

reference "fig:Ratio-of-intra-to-intergroup"

\end_inset

, which increases the mean intergroup interaction strength).We should mention
 two potential biases associated with this comparison: low-dimensional matrices
 tended to be more complete (less sparse) than high-dimensional matrices,
 as these small interaction matrices were used to study known interaction
 phenomena (observed predation between organisms, for instance).
 There is therefore a positive correlation between sparsity and dimensionality
 (Supplementary Fig.

).
 The number of parameters to estimate increase as the square of the number
 of interacting groups, leading authors to reduce this set before the estimation
 process.
 A second caveat is that while we informed our model selection by phylogeny
 (see above), several authors have reduced the number of estimated parameters
 by an automated procedure, usually based on the comparison of 100 randomly
 chosen interaction matrices, optimizing BIC

.
 The latter choice may bias high non-zero interactions in the previous literatur
e, which is why we decided to present in the main text interaction matrices
 including coefficients set to zero, which should be more robust to the
 model selection method.
