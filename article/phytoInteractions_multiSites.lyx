Introduction

\begin_layout Standard
How species or related genera can coexist together in spite of likely competitio
n is still one of the main puzzles of community ecology, especially for
 primary producers that seemingly share the same basic resources [REFS].
 Many theoretical studies of competition models have shown that competitive
 exclusion is likely in those circumstances [REFs], unless some special
 mechanisms involving spatial or temporal variation are at play

 First, we observe a strong self-regulation for all sites (Fig.

 Second, although the percentage of facilitative interactions seem to vary
 among sites [insert percentages here], we have found that it is substantial
 for all sites: contrary to our initial expectations, commensalism (the
 interactions are rarely two-way mutualism [check]) seems to be the rule
 rather than the exception.

We then asked whether the stability (resilience) of those matrices was affected
 by the percentage of mutualistic interactions or their connectivity properties
 (Fig.
 2).
 Neither the percentage of mutualistic interactions nor the complexity metrics
 did strongly affect the stability properties, although there was perhaps
 a slight decline with the percentage of mutualistic interactions (but it
 may be simply due to an unbalance in this percentage, usually high, in
 the datasets).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
More information than sign and the magnitude of interspecific / intergroup
 interactions can be gathered from interaction matrices.
 We investigated whether the matrix has some particular structure that could
 help theoretical ecology to make better null models of joint community
 dynamics and interactions [REF? There's this Am Nat paper by Alex Best
 I think on what's currently amiss with random matrix theory...]
\change_inserted -2100369821 1543940096
 [Not found]
\change_unchanged
.
 We defined two scores, vulnerability (summed effect of others on the focal
 species growth rate) and generality (summed effect of the focal species
 onto other species growth rates).
 Species that were more self-regulating also had also a higher vulnerability
 score, and those two influences are likely to trade-off: a high degree
 of self-regulation somehow buffers outside influences.
 Species that were less self-regulating were also more likely to have a
 broad range of effects onto other species [to interpret this we may also
 need to check that they were more abundant, if so I would say that species
 varying broadly have a higher likelihood to generate effects in other species].
 It is important to note, however, that these patterns are weak and there
 is therefore a considerable amount of randomness dominating the interaction
 matrix: many scenarios of self-regulation vs limitation by others are therefore
 possible.

Perhaps we have to dig a little more in the identity of those species there.
 Can we relate some of the species that have widespread effects on many
 species to traits? Are these always the same in the various regions? In
 the various sites?
\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aside from these trade-offs, some of which promote some stability (sensu
 invariability), we found no remarkable patterns of covariation between
 matrix elements (other than a mean-variance scaling of interaction coefficients
, see SI XXX Fig.
 XXX).
 The big finding of our study seems really to be the presence of very large
 niche differences between the species, translating into a much higher intragrou
p competition, together with a high degree of facilitative net interactions.
 In our previous publication [REF], we have argued that those could arise
 from predation effects that could well create apparent mutualism between
 prey species and strong intragroup density-dependence [REFs].
 This is still very much likely here given our new study regions (Oléron,
 Britanny, Mediterranean) could have similar predators, though there are
 other possibilities.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Finally, we have sought to put these results in a broader context by compiling
 the intra vs.
 inter group estimates of previous MAR(1) studies (detailed in Appendix
 XXX).
 We have found that the order of magnitude of intra/inter interaction strengths
 considered here (
\begin_inset Formula $\approx$
\end_inset

 10) not particularly below those found for most planktonic systems.
 We include in Fig.
 4 not only plankton studies but also a couple of vertebrate or insect studies
 on smaller (less diverse) communities were interactions are stronger.
 The conclusion from this comparison seems to be that any diverse system
 of competitors and facilitators seem to have evolved large niche differences
 making intragroup competition much higher than intergroup interactions.

, and might be due to the ghost of the competition past, i.e., selection and
 evolution leading to progressive niche separation.
 Species have evolved niches that allow them not to compete or to interact
 only weakly (very strong facilitative effects might be likewise destabilizing
 [je crois qu'il y a des refs sur les effets non-monotone des interactions
 +, je rechercherai]).
 The predator effects that we highlighted above can be comprised within
 such niche differentation sensu largo: specialized predators can make strong
 conspecific density-dependence emerge [REFs], while switching generalists
 can also promote diversity [REFs, same from Oikos].
 Both predators and resources have often symmetrical effects and can contribute
 to niche differentation

 This could occur for instance if species are spatially segregated (at a
 small scale) because each species only exists within a domain where it
 is relatively competitive, while a focal species could spread out if competitor
s were removed.
 This means that a species can be limited by competitors, but act so as
 to minimize competition (a little like avoidance behaviour in animals)
 so that competition is i effect hard to detect when all species are present.
 This would require some fine-scale segregation between phytoplankton species
 at the scale of interactions, i.e., at the microscale.
 At the moment, it is known that turbulence generates inhomogeneities at
 the microscale

[Not sure about what I am writing below, some ideas about the resistant
 / benthic life stage – if there were strong competition in a well-mixed
 media but a stage structure, we would still expect to see some degree of
 competition in the pelagic surveys I think – my guess would be that competition
 between the pelagic stage is always weak because of hidden spatial structure,
 and resistant life-stage only adds to this the possibility for

 coexistence because recolonization from zero without outside flow becomes

\begin_layout Plain Layout
A final possibility relates to stage structure.
 We have so far referred to the pelagic component of the phytoplankton community
, which is what is sampled and analysed here.
 However, many of the organisms followed here have resistance form.
 These resistance forms, that can sink to the sea bottom, can easily be
 remobilized in the water column after storms, which combined to a rise
 in irradiance, can generate blooms.
 This may greatly help coexistence by frequent recolonization in the coastal
 and therefore shallow marine habitats that are considered here, and may
 dampen or even hide the possible effects of competition.

[Insert here a detailed description of the MAR(1) approach, a little bit
 as we did in the Oikos paper, but perhaps a little more self-contained].
 In general, MAR(1) models tend to be fairly robust to small deviations
 of the underlying data-generating model, provided that one asks mainly
 order of magnitude of coefficients values (rather than very precise estimates)
 and sign of interaction coefficients [REF Certain]
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We have previously published a very detailed analysis of one of the dataset
 (Arcachon) for which more covariables were available [REF Oikos].
 The analysis of real data was complemented by that of simulated data for
 a plankton time series set-up and confirmed the ability of the technique
 to infer biotic interactions and abiotic forcing [REF Oikos].
 This analysis revealed that the MAR(1) approach was satisfactory (no need
 for extra non-linearities to model the storage effect, which was found
 to be weak as in previous analyses of plant data for which strong-self
 regulation was observed
