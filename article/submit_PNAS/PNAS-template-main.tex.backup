\begin{abstract}
The persistence of phytoplanktonic diversity in spite
of competition for basic resources has long been a source of wonder
and inspiration to ecologists. To sort out, among the many coexistence
mechanisms suggested by theory and experiments, which ones actually
maintain diversity in natural ecosystems, long-term field studies
are paramount. Here, we analyse a large dataset of phytoplankton abundance
time series, counted every two weeks over 20 years, at 10 sites along
the French coastline. We estimate biotic interactions using dynamic,
multispecies autoregressive models. We show that a strong self-regulation,
with competition strength within a genus an order of magnitude higher
than between genera, was present in all phytoplanktonic interaction
networks. Furthermore, positive net effects between phytoplanktonic
taxa constituted at least 40\% of non-null interactions in all sites.
Both strong self-regulation and widespread net facilitation should
therefore be key features of coexistence mechanisms intending to explain
phytoplankton diversity maintenance.

\dropcap{H}ow species or close genera can coexist together in spite of competition
is one of the main puzzles of community ecology, especially for primary
producers that seemingly share the same basic resources \supercite{hutchinson_paradox_1961}.
Many theoretical studies of competition models have shown that competitive
exclusion is likely in those circumstances\supercite{armstrong1980competitive,chesson_updates_2018},
unless mechanisms involving spatial or temporal variation are at play\supercite{armstrong1976coexistence,chesson_roles_1997,huisman_biological_2001,li_effects_2016}.
Neutral theory, that assumes a non-equilibrium coexistence maintained
by dispersal and equal competitive abilities for all species\supercite{hubbell_unified_2001}
(though there are exceptions \supercite{volkov_neutral_2003,volkov_patterns_2007})
has been proposed as a solution to explain highly diverse communities\supercite{hubbell_unified_2001,rosindell2011unified}.

However, the evidence gathered from terrestrial plant communities
starts to suggest that, in fact, niche rather than neutral processes
may be paramount to explain coexistence, with intraspecific competition
dwarfing interspecific competition in most cases\supercite{adler_coexistence_2010,adler_competition_2018}.
Whether these conclusions drawn from studies of annual plants and
forest trees apply to other ecosystems and taxa is currently little
known (but see Mutshinda et al.\supercite{mutshinda_what_2009}).

Moreover, even within a single trophic level, competition may not
be the rule: the meta-analysis by Adler et al.\supercite{adler_competition_2018}
reported a large number of facilitative interactions (30\%) and several
reviews\supercite{brooker_facilitation_2008,mcintire2014facilitation}
have highlighted that facilitation may be much more widespread than
ecologists usually tend to think. Although some theoretical studies
suggest that facilitative interactions can be destabilizing (\emph{sensu}
resilience) and therefore undermine coexistence in Lotka-Volterra
models\supercite{coyte_ecology_2015}, multiple other modelling \supercite{gross_positive_2008}
and empirical\supercite{brooker_facilitation_2008,cavieres2009facilitative}
studies have suggested that facilitative interactions can to a large
degree benefit coexistence, especially when multiple interaction types
are considered simultaneously\supercite{mougi2012diversity,garcia2018effect}.

Here, we study a large multi-species dataset consisting of several
multivariate long-term time series of phytoplankton dynamics along
the French coastline, which we then analyse using multivariate autoregressive
(MAR) time series models, allowing for interactions between genera.
Although many ecological studies focus on interactions between species,
competition has been shown experimentally to occur between different
genera of phytoplankton \supercite{titman_ecological_1976,descamps-julien_stable_2005}.
The genus level is also a rather fine taxonomic scale for phytoplankton
interaction studies, as most studies are restricted to interaction
between different classes or even phyla\supercite{ives_estimating_2003,hampton_sixty_2008,griffiths_phytoplankton_2015}.
Studying interactions between different genera of phytoplankton therefore
both makes empirical sense in light of competition experiments and
allows to estimate better-resolved networks. We focus here on genera
that belong mostly to diatoms and dinoflagellates. To put our results
into a more general context, we then compare our interaction strength
estimates to previously published interaction networks produced under
the same statistical framework, both in plankton and other empirical
systems.

\section*{Guide to using this template on Overleaf}

Please note that whilst this template provides a preview of the typeset manuscript for submission, to help in this preparation, it will not necessarily be the final publication layout. For more detailed information please see the \href{http://www.pnas.org/site/authors/format.xhtml}{PNAS Information for Authors}.

If you have a question while using this template on Overleaf, please use the help menu (``?'') on the top bar to search for \href{https://www.overleaf.com/help}{help and tutorials}. You can also \href{https://www.overleaf.com/contact}{contact the Overleaf support team} at any time with specific questions about your manuscript or feedback on the template.

\subsection*{Author Affiliations}

Include department, institution, and complete address, with the ZIP/postal code, for each author. Use lower case letters to match authors with institutions, as shown in the example. Authors with an ORCID ID may supply this information at submission.

\subsection*{Submitting Manuscripts}

All authors must submit their articles at \href{http://www.pnascentral.org/cgi-bin/main.plex}{PNAScentral}. If you are using Overleaf to write your article, you can use the ``Submit to PNAS'' option in the top bar of the editor window. 

\subsection*{Format}

Many authors find it useful to organize their manuscripts with the following order of sections;  Title, Author Affiliation, Keywords, Abstract, Significance Statement, Results, Discussion, Materials and methods, Acknowledgments, and References. Other orders and headings are permitted.

\subsection*{Manuscript Length}

PNAS generally uses a two-column format averaging 67 characters, including spaces, per line. The maximum length of a Direct Submission research article is six pages and a Direct Submission Plus research article is ten pages including all text, spaces, and the number of characters displaced by figures, tables, and equations.  When submitting tables, figures, and/or equations in addition to text, keep the text for your manuscript under 39,000 characters (including spaces) for Direct Submissions and 72,000 characters (including spaces) for Direct Submission Plus.

\subsection*{References}

References should be cited in numerical order as they appear in text; this will be done automatically via bibtex, e.g. \cite{belkin2002using} and \cite{berard1994embedding,coifman2005geometric}. All references should be included in the main manuscript file.  

\subsection*{Data Archival}

PNAS must be able to archive the data essential to a published article. Where such archiving is not possible, deposition of data in public databases, such as GenBank, ArrayExpress, Protein Data Bank, Unidata, and others outlined in the Information for Authors, is acceptable.

\subsection*{Language-Editing Services}
Prior to submission, authors who believe their manuscripts would benefit from professional editing are encouraged to use a language-editing service (see list at www.pnas.org/site/authors/language-editing.xhtml). PNAS does not take responsibility for or endorse these services, and their use has no bearing on acceptance of a manuscript for publication.

\end{SCfigure*}

\subsection*{Digital Figures}

Only TIFF, EPS, and high-resolution PDF for Mac or PC are allowed for figures that will appear in the main text, and images must be final size. Authors may submit U3D or PRC files for 3D images; these must be accompanied by 2D representations in TIFF, EPS, or high-resolution PDF format.  Color images must be in RGB (red, green, blue) mode. Include the font files for any text. 

Figures and Tables should be labelled and referenced in the standard way using the \verb|\label{}| and \verb|\ref{}| commands.

Figure \ref{fig:frog} shows an example of how to insert a column-wide figure. To insert a figure wider than one column, please use the \verb|\begin{figure*}...\end{figure*}| environment. Figures wider than one column should be sized to 11.4 cm or 17.8 cm wide. Use \verb|\begin{SCfigure*}...\end{SCfigure*}| for a wide figure with side captions.

\subsection*{Tables}
In addition to including your tables within this manuscript file, PNAS requires that each table be uploaded to the submission separately as a “Table” file.  Please ensure that each table .tex file contains a preamble, the \verb|\begin{document}| command, and the \verb|\end{document}| command. This is necessary so that the submission system can convert each file to PDF.

\subsection*{Single column equations}

Authors may use 1- or 2-column equations in their article, according to their preference.

To allow an equation to span both columns, use the \verb|\begin{figure*}...\end{figure*}| environment mentioned above for figures.

Note that the use of the \verb|widetext| environment for equations is not recommended, and should not be used.
