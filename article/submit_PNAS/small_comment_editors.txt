Dear Editor(s), 

In the submitted manuscript, we show how many species and genera of coastal phytoplankton manage to coexist, through the statistical analysis of ten long-term phytoplankton surveys at the community level. How diverse communities can coexist, especially plankton communities, is a major puzzle of ecology; our analysis based on observational data clears out this issue by pointing towards widespread niche differentiation, in opposition to neutral or non-equilibrium theories developed in the last decades. We further report widespread facilitative interactions, our detailed cover letter and article explain with more depth the theoretical ramifications of these results. We believe that the clear, unambiguous results that we found here, based on high-resolution long-term community data, will be able to provide a clear answer to the plankton paradox, framed in simple terms for PNAS broad readership. 

With our best regards, 

Frédéric Barraquand & Coralie Picoche
