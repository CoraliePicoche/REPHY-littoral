Abstract
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The persistence of phytoplanktonic diversity in spite of competition for
 basic resources has long been a source of wonder and inspiration to ecologists.
 To sort out, among the many coexistence mechanisms suggested by theory
 and experiments, which ones actually maintain diversity in natural ecosystems,
 long-term field studies are paramount.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We analysed a large dataset of phytoplankton abundance time series using
 dynamic, multivariate autoregressive models.
 Phytoplankton was counted and identified down to the genus level, every
 two weeks over twenty years, at ten sites along the French coastline.
 Multivariate autoregressive models allowed to estimate biotic interaction
 networks, while also accounting for abiotic variables that may drive part
 of the phytoplankton fluctuations.
 We then analysed the ratio of intra- to inter-taxa interactions (measuring
 self-regulation, itself a measure of niche differentiation), the frequency
 of negative vs positive interactions, and how stability metrics (both at
 the network and genus level) relate to the network complexity and genus
 self-regulation or abundance.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
We showed that a strong self-regulation, with competition strength within
 a taxon (genus) an order of magnitude higher than between taxa, was present
 in all phytoplanktonic interaction networks.
 This much stronger intragenus competition suggests that niche differentiation
 - rather than neutrality - is commonplace in phytoplankton.
 Furthermore, interaction networks were dominated by positive net effects
 between phytoplanktonic taxa (above 50% of non-zero interactions on average).
 While network stability (
\shape italic
sensu
\shape default
 resilience) was unrelated to complexity measures, we unveiled links between
 self-regulation, intergenus interaction strengths and abundance.
 The less common taxa tend to be more strongly self-regulated and can therefore
 maintain in spite of competition with abundant ones.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate

\shape italic
Synthesis
\shape default
: We prove that strong niche differentiation, widespread facilitation between
 phytoplanktonic taxa and stabilizing covariances between interaction strengths
 should be common features of coexisting phytoplankton communities in the
 field.
 These are structural properties that we can expect to emerge from plausible
 mechanistic models of phytoplankton communities.
 We discuss mechanisms, such as predation or restricted microscale movement,
 that are consistent with these findings, which paves the way for further
 research.

How species or close genera can coexist together in spite of competition
 is one of the main puzzles of community ecology, especially for primary
 producers that seemingly share the same basic resources

 Many theoretical studies of competition models have shown that competitive
 exclusion is likely in those circumstances, unless mechanisms involving
 spatial or temporal variation are at play

However, the evidence gathered from terrestrial plant communities starts
 to suggest that, in fact, niche rather than neutral processes may be paramount
 to explain coexistence, with intraspecific competition dwarfing interspecific
 competition in most cases

 apply to other ecosystems and taxa is currently little known (but see

Here, we analyse a spatially replicated, long-term community-level dataset,
 consisting of ten multivariate time series of phytoplankton abundance along
 the French coastline.
 The time series are modelled using multivariate autoregressive (MAR) models,
 allowing for interactions between genera.
 Although many ecological studies focus on interactions between species,
 competition has been shown experimentally to occur between different genera
 of phytoplankton

LatexCommand citep
key "titman_ecological_1976,descamps-julien_stable_2005"

 The genus level is also a rather fine taxonomic scale for phytoplankton
 interaction studies, as most studies are restricted to interactions between
 different classes or even phyla

key "ives_estimating_2003,hampton_sixty_2008,griffiths_phytoplankton_2015"

\end_inset

.
 Studying interactions between different genera of phytoplankton therefore
 both makes empirical sense in light of competition experiments and allows
 to estimate better-resolved networks.
 We focus here on genera that belong mostly to diatoms and dinoflagellates.
 To put our results into a more general context, we then compare our interaction
 strength estimates to previously published interaction networks produced
 under the same statistical framework, both in plankton and other empirical
 systems.

 as part of the National Phytoplankton and Phycotoxin Monitoring Network
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Since 1987, this monitoring program has required the sampling of 26 sites
 along the French coastline every 2 weeks within 2 hours of high tide to
 document both biotic (phytoplankton counts) and abiotic (water temperature,
 salinity) variables.
 We focused on sites which had the longest time series.
 We also excluded time series which had missing data for over 6 months or
 an average delay between sampling dates above 20 days.
 This reduced the number of study sites to 10 sites nested within 4 regions
 (Brittany, Oléron, Arcachon and the Mediterranean Sea; Fig.
\begin_inset space ~

S1 and Table S1).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Abiotic variables (temperature, salinity) were measured directly from the
 boat during the sampling process while water samples for biotic analyses
 were fixed with a Lugol's solution and examined later.
 Phytoplankton cells above 20 
\begin_inset Formula $\mu$

 the Utermöhl method using an optical microscope 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

.
 Throughout the years and sites, more than 600 taxa were identified at different
 taxonomic levels.
 We aggregated them at the genus (or group of genera when not possible)
 level based on previous work (Table S2; 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "hernandez_farinas_assessing_2015,barraquand_coastal_2018"

\end_inset

), except for cryptophytes and euglenophytes in Arcachon, which could not
 be identified below the family level.
 Although the taxonomic resolution used here may seem coarse in comparison
 to land plants, it is in fact more refined than 86% of the MAR(1) studies
 of phytoplankton listed in Table

For each region, the MAR(1) analysis focused on the most abundant and most
 frequently observed genera to avoid most of the gaps in the time series.
 Time series are plotted in Fig.

 When gaps did not exceed a month, missing values were linearly interpolated;
 remaining missing values were replaced by a random number between 0 and
 half of the lowest observed abundance

Our previous analysis of the Arcachon region, for which more covariables

\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep

 dynamics than nutrients on the two-week timescale.
 Because temperature and salinity sum up seasonal changes in light as well
 as hydrology (salinity is inversely related to freshwater inflow), these
 represent the two key drivers needed to account for abiotic influences

The analysis of real data in

 was complemented by that of simulated data mimicking the study design,
 which confirmed the ability of MAR(1) models to infer biotic interactions
 and abiotic forcings.
 Fitting a more sophisticated model (threshold autoregressive model) did
 not reveal extra non-linearities or a storage effect in the Arcachon subset
 of the data 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "barraquand_coastal_2018"

 Other aspects of the MAR(1) modelling are likewise quite robust: using
 two abiotic variables (temperature and salinity) in this study rather than
 the full set used in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

 led to almost identical covariate effects and interaction estimates for
 the Arcachon study sites.
 Even if some departures from the true data-generating model may not always
 be detectable through MAR(1) diagnostics (e.g., residuals), the analysis
 of nonlinear simulations has showed that MAR(1) models are in general robust
 to nonlinearities if the inference focuses on interaction sign and order
 of magnitude of model coefficients 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "certain_how_2018"

\end_inset

, which is how these models are used here.
 For ease of interpretation of MAR(1) interaction coefficients, we also
 prove the correspondence between the magnitude of intra/inter interaction
 strength in a MAR(1) model and a multispecies Beverton-Holt model, i.e.,
 a discrete-time Lotka-Volterra model

In this study, the number of phytoplankton taxa (
\begin_inset Formula $S$
\end_inset

) and the community composition vary slightly between regions but sites
 share on average 67% of their taxa.
 In order to have comparable models, we also keep the same 2 covariates,
 i.e., water temperature and salinity, that were measured at all study sites.
 Therefore, the dimension of the dynamical system depends on the (square
 of the) number of phytoplankton taxa we study, which ranges between 7 (Mediterr
anean Sea) and 14 (Brittany).
 The smallest system still requires 63 parameters to be estimated (49 for
 the 
\begin_inset Formula $7\times7$
\end_inset

 interaction matrices and 14 for the 
\begin_inset Formula $7\times2$
\end_inset

 environment matrices) if we consider all possible interactions between
 taxa.
 To reduce this dimensionality and remove unnecessary parameters, we built
 different `interaction scenarios' based on known phylogenetic information

 The null interaction scenario assumed no interaction between genera (diagonal
 interaction matrix) and was compared to four other interaction scenarios.
 The first interaction scenario assumed that interactions could only occur
 between phylogenetically close organisms, i.e., within a class (groups were
 then diatoms, dinoflagellates, and other phytoplanktonic organisms) while
 the second interaction scenario further differentiated pennate and centric
 diatoms.
 The third interaction scenario considered the reverse hypothesis, that
 only unrelated organisms could interact (i.e., a diatom could only interact
 with a dinoflagellate or a cryptophyte, but not with another diatom), and
 the last interaction scenario did not constrain the interactions at all
 (full interaction matrix).
 We selected the best scenario by comparing BIC (Fig
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

S3), which proved to be satisfactory in our previous analyses of both real
 data and similar simulated datasets (

 The second interaction scenario, hereafter called the pennate-centric scenario,
 had the lowest BIC for all sites (Fig.

 This parsimonious scenario was therefore chosen as the basis for further

 Weighted connectance is a measure of the proportion of realized links compared

 This metric is adapted to weighted interaction matrices but cannot accommodate

 In contrast, mean and variance of the off-diagonal coefficients, which

 We then compared these to the regulation a focal species exerted on itself.
 Raw values indicate the average effect that can be expected on the growth
 rate of a taxon from the rest of the community (i.e., is the effect of others
 mostly positive or negative?), while absolute effects characterise the
 strength of all types of interactions on a taxon (i.e., is a taxon strongly

 Authors usually reported only coefficients that were significant at the
 95% significance threshold, thus ignoring potentially many weak effects,
 which we had to set to 0.
 There are therefore two ways of computing the mean intertaxa interactions,
 i.e., taking the mean value of all coefficients outside of the matrix diagonal,
 including zeroes (which decreases the estimated mean intertaxa interaction
 strength, Fig.

 The ratio of mean intragenus to intergenus interaction coefficients varied
 between 6 and 10, not counting coefficients set to 0 in the estimation
 process.
 When we included the zeroes in the interaction matrix in the computation
 of the intra/inter mean interaction strength, the ratio rised to 21-43.
 Therefore, intragenus interactions were on average one order of magnitude
 stronger than intergenus interactions

Second, although the percentage of facilitative interactions varied among
 sites (between 40% and 71% of interactions in the selected models), facilitatio
n remained predominant in 9 sites out of 10 (only Lazaret, in the Mediterranean
 Sea, has 60% negative interactions).
 Our observational setup being nested, with sites within regions, we could
 examine whether locally positive interactions remain positive in a regional
 context: the percentage of consistently positive interactions at the regional
 level varied between 30% and 53%, higher than the percentage of similarly
 defined negative interactions (between 15% and 40%), except for sites in
 the Mediterranean Sea.

 over all sites, 32% of all interactions were (+/+) while only 12% of them
 were (-/-), see also Fig

 The sign correspondence was not always maintained between regions: the
 only interaction that was non-zero in the 10 sites (CHA/SKE) was mutualistic
 in Men er Roue only (Brittany) and mixed (+/-) in all other sites.
 Within the same region, however, interactions measured in different sites
 tended to keep the same sign.
 In the 3 sites of Oléron, for instance, there were 4 interactions which
 remained positive for both taxa involved (CHA/GUI, DIT/GUI, LEP/THP, SKE/THP),
 3 of them being also mutualistic in some of the Brittany sites.
 This contradicts previous observations that mutualistic interactions tend
 to be more context-dependent than competitive interactions

): genera that were more self-regulating also had also a higher vulnerability
 score and a lower impact score.
 Those two influences are likely to trade-off: a high degree of self-regulation
 somehow buffers the effect of outside influences on population dynamics.
 Taxa that were less self-regulating were also more likely to have a stronger
 effect onto other taxa.
 As these genera tended to be more abundant (Fig
\begin_inset space ~

S7), this could be mediated by the average density of a genus.
 It is important to note, however, that these trends are weak and there
 is therefore a considerable amount of randomness dominating the interaction
 matrix: many scenarios of self-regulation vs limitation by others are therefore
 possible.

 We found that the order of magnitude of intra/inter interaction strengths
 considered here is not particularly above those found for most planktonic
 systems to which MAR(1) models have been fitted, considering that our systems
 are relatively high-dimensional and that the higher the number of taxa,
 the larger the intraspecific regulation

 not only plankton studies but also a couple of vertebrate or insect studies
 on less diverse communities, where interactions are stronger, in order
 to provide lower bounds for the intra/inter ratio.
 The conclusion from this comparison seems to be that, unlike small communities
 that can be tight-knit, any diverse field system of competitors and facilitator
s has evolved large niche differences making intragroup competition much
 larger in magnitude than intergroup interactions.

 higher intragenus than intergenus effects on growth rates (i.e., strong self-regu

\begin_layout Standard
The rather high intra/intertaxa interaction strength ratio 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "levine_importance_2009"

\end_inset

 that we found, from 5 to 20, depending on how one counts the interactions
 set to zero in the estimation process, could appear extremely high in light
 of previous intra/interspecific competition strength estimates of 4 to
 5 by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet

\end_inset

.
 Even though their model is a different one, i.e., Lotka-Volterra competition,
 we prove in the Supporting Information that the intra/inter ratio should
 remain commensurate in a MAR(1) model.
 The difference in the intra/inter ratio that we found should therefore
 lie elsewhere, which requires some explanation.
 One could argue that such high intra/inter ratio arises because we consider
 the genus as our baseline taxonomic unit, rather than the species.
 It is logical that niche differentiation increases as one gets up the phylogene
tic tree, and that getting down to the species level could slightly decrease
 that ratio (but see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "narwani_ecological_2017"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, in which phylogenetic closeness decreases competition strength).
 However, there are two arguments suggesting that the niche differences
 found here extend to the species level.
 First, phytoplankton species belonging to different genera are often found
 to compete in experiments 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "titman_ecological_1976,tilman_phytoplankton_1982,descamps-julien_stable_2005"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 In the field-based dataset studied here, the same genera that are considered
 in experiments are found not to compete (or only weakly), hence there must
 be some niche differentiation occurring in the field but not in the lab.
 Second, the only other study that managed to provide MAR(1) estimates down
 to the species level for phytoplankton, that of 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "huber_role_2006"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, provides an intra/interspecific strength ratio similar to ours (point
 7a in Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset


\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:meta_ratio"
plural "false"
caps "false"
noprefix "false"

).
 Strong self-regulation seems therefore a genuine feature of field phytoplankton
ic communities.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another main finding of our study is the large frequency of positive interaction
s, with 30% truly mutualistic (+/+) interactions and between 40 and 70%
 facilitative effects.
 Although a seasonal environment can generate some positive covariation
 between taxa, those effects have already been filtered out by the inclusion
 of our 2 abiotic covariates (Fig.
\begin_inset space ~
\end_inset

S4).
 The facilitative effects shown here are therefore residual effects, once
 abiotic trends are accounted for.
 Between 40 and 70% facilitation can be compared to the meta-analysis by
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "adler_competition_2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

 who also found facilitative interactions, but less than here (
\begin_inset Formula $\approx$

30%).
 However, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

 with field examples of facilitation 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "brooker_facilitation_2008,mcintire2014facilitation"
literal "false"

\end_inset

, so that plant facilitation could be higher in the field.
 At the moment, it is therefore unknown how the predominance of facilitative
 interactions that we found in phytoplankton compares to facilitation in
 terrestrial plants.
 We note that several authors using MAR(1) models previously forbade positive
 interactions within the same trophic level, so that the fraction of facilitativ
e interactions in plankton cannot be computed from literature-derived MAR(1)
 estimates.

No complexity-stability relationship but connections between self-regulation
 and intergroup interactions
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There was no relation between the complexity of the communities (measured
 as either the weighted connectance or the interaction coefficient variance
 of the interaction matrices) and their stability (measured by the dominant
 eigenvalue of the interaction matrix, which quantifies the return time
 to a point equilibrium, i.e., resilience).
 This result is conditional upon our model being a good approximate description
 of the system (i.e., no multiyear limit cycles or chaotic attractors as the
 mapping between eigenvalues and actual stability is distorted in that case,
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "certain_how_2018"

 However, we already showed on a subset of this data that a fixed point
 in a MAR(1) model, perturbed by seasonality and abiotic variables, is an
 accurate description of the system 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "barraquand_coastal_2018"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 Therefore, we are confident that the absence of complexity-resilience relations
hip found here is not an artefact of a wrong model.
 This absence of direct link between complexity and stability could be an
 actual feature of empirical systems, as shown previously by 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "jacquet_no_2016"

 using a different technique.
 This result seems to contradict theory based on random matrices, especially
 for competitive and/or mutualistic networks 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "allesina_stability_2012"

 However, this could also be linked to the limited size of our networks,
 as random matrix theory relies on asymptotics 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "allesina_stabilitycomplexity_2015"
literal "false"

\end_inset

.
 We should also mention that our interaction matrices (discrete-time model)
 are not strictly analogous to the ones used in classical random matrix
 theory (continuous-time model).
 Thus the jury is still out regarding the absence of complexity-resilience
 relation, though it may well be a genuine absence.
 In addition to complexity metrics, we also found that the percentage of
 mutualistic interactions, that is thought to affect the stability of a
 network, either positively or negatively

 a relation emerged between self-regulation, necessary for coexistence,

 We found that the more a genus is self-regulated, the more it tends to

 High self-regulation usually indicates large niche differences with the
 rest of the community, and it makes therefore sense that a species/genus

 This is what we expect under strong niche partitioning.
 Furthermore, a low self-regulation was correlated with high average abundance,

 who demonstrated that rare species usually show stronger self-regulation.
 This correlation between relative rarity and self-regulation could also
 explain the lesser impact of highly self-regulated species/genus: a taxon
 which dominates the community composition can have a major effect on the
 others, especially as they usually cover more space, while it is harder
 for the least common taxa to have large impacts.
 However, it was more difficult to explain the relationship between self-regulat
ion and vulnerability: a genus that is more self-regulated and less common
 was found here to be on average more vulnerable to other genera's increases
 in densities.
 Such relation implies greater stability (

\end_inset

) for the network as a whole, because the taxa that are the more vulnerable
 to other taxa's impacts are also those whose dynamics are intrinsically
 more buffered.
 By which mechanisms this could happen is so far unclear and open to speculation.
 It could be just a

\end_inset

: common taxa are in high enough numbers to deplete resources or change
 the environment in ways that affects the less common ones, but the reverse
 is not true.
 We caution, however, that the relationships between vulnerability, impact
 and self-regulation that we evidenced are all relatively weak: considerable
 stochasticity still dominates the distribution of interaction matrix coefficien
ts.

Overall, the dominance of niche differentiation in observational plankton
 studies – based on our analysis of the REPHY dataset and re-analysis of
 the MAR(1) literature – is similar to what has been recently found in plant
 community studies

 or empirically parameterized food webs including horizontal diversity

.
 Large niche differences might be due to the ghost of competition past,
 i.e., competition has occurred in the past, leading to strong selection and
 subsequent evolution, and then to progressive niche separation.
 In this scenario, species have evolved niches that allow them not to compete
 or to interact only weakly (very strong facilitative effects might be likewise
 destabilizing, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealp
key "coyte_ecology_2015"

\end_inset

).
 The likely predator effects that we highlighted above could be comprised
 within such niche differentiation

 Both predators and resources have often symmetrical effects and can therefore

, suggests by contrast that spatial distributions in relation to abiotic
 factors might have a large impact on the interaction strengths inferred
 from temporal interaction models such as ours.
 Recent combinations of model fitting and removal experiments have shown
 that the model fitting usually underestimates the effect of competitors
 that are uncovered by removal experiments

 This could occur for instance if species are spatially segregated (at a
 small scale) because each species only exists within a domain where it
 is relatively competitive (Pacala's spatial segregation hypothesis, 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citealt
key "pacala1997biologically"
literal "false"

\end_inset

), while a focal species could spread out if competitors were removed.
 This means that a species can be limited by competitors, but act so as
 to minimize competition (a little like avoidance behaviour in animals)
 and maximize opportunities for positive interactions, which implies that
 competition is in effect hard to detect when all species are present.
 This would require spatial segregation between phytoplankton species at
 the scale of interactions, i.e., at the microscale.
 At the moment, it is known that the fine-scale hydrodynamics generate inhomogen
eities at the microscale 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "barton_impact_2014,breier_emergence_2018"

 but it is quite unclear how this affects multivariate spatial patterns
 of species distributions (

 Moreover, even if microscale hydrodynamics generates spatial structure
