1) "the authors should check carefully to ensure they cited the correct references. For example, Line 9, both Volkov et al 2003 and 2007 papers advocate the neutral model, not niche differentiation. Also see line 342."
l.9 "Neutral theory, that assumes a non-equilibrium coexistence
maintained by dispersal and equal competitive abilities for all species (Hubbell 2001, though there
are exceptions, see Volkov et al. 2003, 2007)"
l.342: "Overall, the dominance of niche differentiation in observational plankton studies – based on our
analysis of the REPHY dataset and re-analysis of the MAR(1) literature – is similar to what has been
recently found in plant community studies (Volkov et al., 2007; Adler et al., 2018b) "

* Volkov et al. (2005,2007,2009) non-neutral; the ref. to the 2003 paper in the first paragraph was indeed confusing. 
* Now we only cite (2007,2009) in the second paragraph. 


2) Missing ref: did not find them in either main txt or SI (or even response to referees)
* Actually we did not find any missing refs; we took this opportunity the check the appropriateness of citations throughout. 

3) "I would mention that many studies conclude that both niche differentiation and neutral theory are operating in community assembly and species coexistence in line 11-15, as stochastic process cannot be excluded in this study system as well."

Explaining that a model is truly neutral if there's no niche differentiation, i.e., equal competitive strengths within and between taxa. 
Even if dispersal contribute to shaping the community, this is unlikely. 

* Theoretical results from our Theor Ecol and other papers --> Hidden niches in the emergent neutrality models
* Need of time series to evaluate neutrality vs competition; so far temporal evidence supports niche differentiation. 
* Stochastic processes are not excluded here; in fact all our fitted models are stochastic.
