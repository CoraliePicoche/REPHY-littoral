\begin{document}

Using a long-term, multi-site coastal phytoplankton survey to estimate interaction strengths, we show that niche differentiation rather than neutrality dominates. We also uncover that facilitation is more frequent than competition and that self-regulation covaries with interaction strengths between taxa and with abundance, which helps coexistence.
