This repository contains all data, scripts and versions of the manuscript *Strong self-regulation and widespread facilitative interactions in phytoplankton communities* (Picoche & Barraquand). In this manuscript, we analyse the interaction matrices of phytoplankton communities, based on multivariate autoregressive (MAR) models. 

The following description is an overview of the different folders. 
1. **article/** shows different versions of the manuscript which was submitted, complemented by a graph subfolder with both figures presented in the paper and other preliminary work or different representation of the same results.
2. **data/** contains all data files used in the manuscript, from raw datasets (directly extracted from larger databases without further treatment), intermediate and final files used as bases for community analysis.
3. **report/** includes the preliminary work done on the data and very preliminary MAR modeling. It also presents a **graph** folder for the figures corresponding to a preliminary report.
4. **script/** contains all scripts to produce the final results of the manuscript and supplementing information, with an **exploratory** subfolder with additional analyses that were not pursued.
