This repository contains all data, scripts and versions of *Strong self-regulation and widespread facilitative interactions in phytoplankton communities* (Picoche & Barraquand). We analyse the interaction matrices of phytoplankton communities, based on multivariate autoregressive (MAR) models and time series of phytoplankton counts.
