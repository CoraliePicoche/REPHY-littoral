This repository contains all data, scripts and versions of the manuscript *Strong self-regulation and widespread facilitative interactions in phytoplankton communities* (Picoche & Barraquand). This work analyses the interaction matrices of phytoplankton communities, based on multivariate autoregressive (MAR) models. 

The following is only an overview of the different folders, which are further described in their own README. 
1. **article/** shows the different versions of the manuscript which was submitted, with a graph subfolder with both figures presented in the paper and other preliminary work or different representation of the same results.
2. **data/** contains all data files used in the manuscript, from raw datasets (directly extracted from larger databases without further treatment), intermediate files and final files used as bases for community analysis.
3. **report/** includes the preliminary work done on the data and very preliminary MAR modeling. It also presents a **graph** folder for the figures corresponding to a preliminary report.
4. **script/** contains all scripts to produce the final results of the manuscript and supplementing information, with an **exploratory** subfolder with additional analyses that were not pursued.
