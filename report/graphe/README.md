This folder contains all graphs intended to explore our data set, or to visualize results from different analyses (MAR estimates, for instance).

The **localisation** folder contains maps locating the different REPHY monitoring sites as well as MeteoFrance sites.

The **exploration_raw** folder contains multiple ways of looking at the data:
- all files ending with "var_time.pdf" show all variables which were monitored, for each sampling point. They do not represent the time series themselves, only the measurement of a variable.
- "Sites_REPHY.pdf" and "Gantt_REPHY.pdf" focus on plankton data: they show at which dates phytoplankton was sampled, but only for the "FLORTOT" variable (all phytoplankton cells are considered, not only the toxic or most abundant ones).
- "boxplot_gap_all.pdf" and "gap_per_season.pdf" show the average duration between two sampling dates, especially when it is over 2 weeks, which is REPHY prescribed frequency. The goal was to remove sites that were not monitored regularly enough.
- the file "comparaison_REPHY_SRN" was used to compare data between two similar monitoring programs in the North of France, as Hernandez-Farinas et al. (2014) have focused on these points. However, the corresponding time series are too short and contain too many gaps to be appropriate for a MAR analysis.
- time series were also plotted for the "FLORPAR" and "FLORIND" variables: these codes correspond to a focus on toxic and/or abundant species.
- still focusing on planktonic data, the files ending with "per_species.pdf" show a first attempt at using exactly the same groups of species as in Barraquand et al. (2018), with the same reconstruction method.
- to choose the species most adapted to the analyses, the file "repartition_taxonomy" and "nb_groups" show the richness of eat site depending on the taxonomic level, and the number of missing values. We then chose to focus on the genus level, with Hernandez et al. (2015) classification. For other classification, see the folder *time_series_classif_old*

The *time_series* folder contains visualization of the data. 
- the *Hernandez* folder only shows raw data, with the proportion of missing values and the average abundance of each group, according to Hernandez et al. (2015) classification. A color code indicates for each point how dominant the species is at one date.
- the *hydro* folder focuses on covariates, their correlation and cross-correlation.
- the *plankton* folder also compares covariation of plankton groups. The "comparaison_SSA_random" files compare a reconstruction method based on Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA), and a random replacement of missing value as done by Hampton et al. 2013. We finally chose to use Hampton's method, to be consistent with Barraquand et al. (2018).

The *MAR_estimates* folder contains all visualization of interaction matrices and comparison of AICc and BIC for MAR estimates. They are separated per location (BZ=South Brittany, MO=Marennes Oleron, AR=Arcachon, SU=South of France, the Mediterranen sites), and per groups of species selected. The interaction models are specified in the names of the files (null=diagonal matrix, unconstrained=full interaction matrix, pencen=pennate and centric diatoms cannot interact with each other, diatdin=diatoms and dinoflagellates cannot interact but pennate and centric diatoms can, inter=there are interactions inter-phyla but no intraphyla: a diatom can interact with a dinoflagellate, but not with another diatom).
There were at first some attempts at building models using NEI either as a covariate or as a species: all results were put in the *with_NEI* folder. There were also models built using only common species from BZ, MO and SU, not taking into account AR: results are in COMMON/without_AR. Both types of models can be ignored now. 
For each location, there is a difference between "subsite_specific" and "site_specific". In the first folder, groups of species can differ between sites of the same region (in Marennes-Oléron, Auger and L'Eperon can have different interacting species), while the "site_specific" folder contains only results for common species between different subsites (in Marennes Oléron, we only consider species that are well-resolved in Auger, L'Eperon and Cornard).
Finally, in the *COMMON* folder, files ending with "subsampling" show interaction coefficients for species that are common to our 4 regions (which means only 4 species), but which were estimated with a model taking into account all species common at one place (which means 14 species at BZ, instead of the resulting 4, for instance).
