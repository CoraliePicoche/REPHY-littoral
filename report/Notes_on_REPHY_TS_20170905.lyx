\begin_layout Standard
We queried the Quadrige database on the 18th of April 2017.
 We filtered data to consider only results from the REPHY network (REPHY-Etudes
 and REPHYTOX were ignored as they are either too short or focused on toxin
 concentrations) from 1987 to the end of 2016.
 Among the 1077 sites where such measurements have been made, we chose to
 focus on the 31 sites which were already used in 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citet
key "hernandez_farinas_analyse_nodate"

\end_inset

.
 Dunkerque, Boulogne and Somme sites were not all present in the database
 as most of them actually belonged to the SRN network (Suivi Régional des
 Nutriments).
 The SRN time series were downloaded on the 11th of May 2017.
 In the following, we excluded one of the SRN sampling site (Mismer) from
 further analyses as it often changed location and bathymetry without notificati
ons.
 We can see the impact of using both REPHY and SRN data for the same sampling
 sites (Point 1 Dunkerque, Point 1 Boulogne, At So and Bif) on Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref

\end_inset

.
 For most sites (Dunkerque, At So, Bif), the SRN data complete and sometimes
 duplicate the observations included in the REPHY programme.
 However, observations in Boulogne are very different for two sampling dates
 in SRN and REPHY.
 In all cases, we only take SRN values when none exists for the same dates
 in the REPHY.

, we first observe that the 1995 training that was relevant for the Arcachon
 Bay actually impacts most of the other sampling sites.
 I would advise to take results only after this date (see for example the
 strange peaks in abundance at Antoine, PSE observations at Loscolo, or
 RHI observations at Cornard...).
 What is more, Bois de la Chaise has been strongly impacted by its location
 shift in 2007: either we consider only values before this date, or we just
 don't use it (we already have data from South Brittany).
 I also have doubts for Croisic site: the RHI and CRY groups may indicate
 a change in observer thay may strongly impact the quality of the time series.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Planktonic groups vary slightly between sites.
 While CHA is a common species at each sampling site, the abundance of AST
 varies between sites and it is not always a dominant group, which makes
 the comparison of interactions between these two groups more difficult.
 Cryptophytes and Euglenophytes are not followed with the same rigour than
 in Arcachon Bay and we may want to ignore them in further analyses, especially
 as we revealed no significant effect of these groups in our previous study.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As far as methods are concerned, we can see that some sites followed PSE
 as a toxic species, which means that the observer looked for this specific
 group and included '0' instead of missing value when it could not be found
 (therefore there are both '0' and missing values in the time series).
 This is the same for AST in Bois de la Chaise and dinoflagellates in At
 So, but there is no 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

toxicity excuse
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

 for this.
 What is more, some sites have a less-than-usual variability for lower abundance
, especially for dinoflagellates (see for instance Auger): we might think
 that it is also observer-related and we may want to introduce a small noise
 around this value.

 Except for Antoine, the length of the time series and the number of different

 When pooling all sites, 660 different taxa have been identified during

 The generic term taxon can represent a species, a group of species, a genus,
 or even a phylum.

\begin_inset Caption Standard

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Relative abundance of identified taxa for different taxonomic levels for
 each site.
 Numbers indicate the different groups which can be found for a taxonomic
 level.
 For example, in Men er Roue, 4 different subphyla are identified throughout
 the whole time series, and about 95% of all taxa are identified at the
 subphylum level whereas 85% of all taxa are identified at the genus level,
 among 100 genera or groups of genera.
 The same information is given in boxes at the bottom left of each graph
 for infraphylum and subclass levels for graphical purposes (values were
 much lower).

 The caption is always the same : Time series for log abundance of observed
 groups of genera at X sampling site (X given by the name of the file).
 The color of the point corresponds to the relative abundance of the group
 at a given sampling date: red corresponds to 95-to-100% of a given group
 whereas cyan corresponds to 25-to-35% of the overall abundance, the exact
 number being given in the top left corner, below the percentage of missing
 values.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Number of planktonic groups whose average proportion in the community is
 above a threshold given on the x-axis (left) or whose maximum proportion
 of missing values is below a threshold on the x-axis (right) for 2 to 8
 out of the 8 sites we consider.
 For example, black dots show that a minimum proportion of 0.05% in the planktoni
c community at all sites can be reached for only 4 groups, whereas if we
 relax the condition to a minimum proportion of 0.05% in 3 sites, 11 groups
 are concerned (green dots).
 Note that the 'NEI' group, while not very accurate for interaction analyses,
 is also included.

Subclass level

\begin_layout Standard
According to WORMS, there are three main subclasses among diatoms: Coscinodiscop
hycidae correspond to Centric organisms whereas Bacillariophycidae and Fragilari
ophycidae correspond to pennate organisms

 that subclasses are identified for more than 80% of the biomass, except
 in Le Croisic, where this value is lower (66%).
 The distinction between such groups is therefore debatable.
 This is the closest I found to so-called 'morpho-functional groups'

Preliminary MAR analyses

\begin_layout Standard
In this section, we first focus on each site separately (later, we can consider
 different sites as repeated observations of the same process in South Brittany
 -BZ/Marennes Oléron -MO/the Mediterranean Sea -SU, that can be used to
 estimate missing data; or just test the existence of a metapopulation.
 This will be discussed in next section).

There are less environmental variables in Marennes Oléron than in Arcachon.
 We chose to focus on temperature and salinity, which were monitored at
 all sites and sampling dates.

\begin_layout Standard
Despite similar trends, it seems that L'Eperon and Cornard are prone to
 stronger decreases in salinity, maybe due to a different bathymetry or
 a proximity to freshwater flow that is not reflected in the salinity in
 Auger.
 A plankton proxy such as chlorophyll also shows the inter-site variability
 of planktonic dynamics.

Similar figures can be found under the names Rapport/graphe/compare_hydrology_*.p
df and Rapport/graphe/compare_plankton_species*.pdf.
 I think this can help explain the differences in coefficients, especillay
 for the effect of salinity - temperature is a bit more stable and might
 both cover temperature/irradiance related effects, and seasonal effects.
 What is more, chl a in South Brittany seems pretty high to me and might
 be discussed...

Spearman correlations between covariates are between 0.46 and 0.60, except
 for the Mediterranean sites: in Antoine, it is 0.004 and 0.04 in Lazaret

\begin_layout Paragraph
A few words about Météo France
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
These environmental values (temperature, salinity) could be completed or
 replaced by MeteoFrance data, using the same variables that we used in
 the first paper.
 We can see on Fig.
 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "fig:Location-of-sampling"

\end_inset

 that all sampling sites seem surrounded by observation sites.
 However, if we want wind-related variables as well as irradiance, there
 are only 7 Météo France which can be used for our REPHY sampling points.
 In South Brittany, only Ploërmel is complete, and it is located from 55.7
 to 72.8 km away from REPHY sampling sites.
 For Marennes-Oléron sites, both Royan and Saintes (or even Fontenay ?)
 can be used.
 For the southernmost sites, both Arles and Bormes les Mimosa can be used,
 but the latter is 40 km away from its closest REPHY sampling point, Lazaret.
 For now, it seems difficult to complete with observed data from buoys,
 as they mostly monitor wind and waves, but not irradiance (but nebulosity
 could be used as a proxy.
 This would mean, however, a small departure from our first analysis).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This led us to the conclusion that we can choose not to use Météo France
 data and keep temperature and salinity which are measured at the exact
 same time and place of plankton samples.
 Irradiance and winds can vary a lot according to the local landform, from
 the coast to inner land, and the distance between climatic observations
 and planktonic sampling might be too big to model the environmental conditions
 of growth for planktonic growth.
 What is more, irradiance and temperature are correlated: it might not be
 useful to use the former instead of the later.
 Wind energy only had a small effect in previous estimations: we may be
 able to drop that variable for now.

 and used two different methods to reconstruct the dynamics of all species,
 by both handling missing values and irregular sampling.
 The first method is the one used in our first paper, based on 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

: missing values were replaced by a random value between 0 and the minimum
 value of the time series.
 The second method, Singular Spectral Analysis, can be described as a principal
 component analysis in the time domain, and is based on the spectral decompositi
on of the signal to fill gaps in the data while keeping its temporal structure

I finally chose to keep the first 'random' method but this could be discussed
 later on.
 I also feel that we may be interested in the comparison of the different
 SSA decomposition (eigen values) of one species at different sites (for
 instance, this might be of interest for the analysis of synchrony for CHA).

This led me to remove some of the species for which gap filling seemed too
 flawed (these were mostly the species for which we weren't sure at first

This only presents a summary of the main results: all analyses are shown
 under the name Rapport/graphe/L_analyse_MAR_X_Y_Z_regular_S.pdf where L
 is the name of the site which is studied, when there is only one, X is
 the name of the model (null/unconstrained/pencen), Y is the way NEI is
 taken into account (as a species -sp ; as a covariate -cov; or not taken
 into account -null) ; Z is either 'single' or 'common' (when different
 sites are taken into account and we only consider common groups of species
 ; the group of sites is given by S, which can be eithr South Brittany -BZ,
 Marennes-Oléron -MR, Mediterranean Sea -SU ; or all sites -ALL).

Methods were the same as in our first paper.
 We did not extract seasonality from temperature and salinity.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
I first wondered how to use information contained in the NEI group: this
 can be used both as a biotic group with a temporal autocorrelation and
 interactions with other species, or as a covariate that can affect planktonic
 groups but cannot be affected by them (just like temperature and salinity).
 The diversity of this group from one sampling to another makes it less
 likely to be influenced by specific groups, or to have an homogeneous response
 to similar covariates: it seems more logical to see it as a covariate.
 However, we first completely removed it from further analyses, as was done
 in the previous paper.

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Comparison of AICc and BIC from different interaction matrices are compared.
 This figure shows the difference between the AICc/BIC of a given model
 and the corresponding criterium of the null (diagonal interaction matrix)
 model.
 A negative value indicates that the model performs better than the null
 model with NEI=cov.
 A positive value indicates that the null model is 'better'.
 As model structures (number of times series taken into account) are different,
 groups of bars should not be compared

Model criteria are not consistent.
 BIC is always more conservative than AICc and tend to select the null model,
 or the pennate/centric model, while AICc tend to select the unconstrained
 or pennate/centric model.

\begin_layout Standard
As was found previously, there are mostly weak and positive interactions
 inter-groups.
 The only difference is in the Mediterranean Sea, where there are mostly
 negative interactions (this is interesting, as this might be the most polluted
 site we consider.
 This is confirmed in the 'single' analyses in which species groups differ
 in Antoine and Lazaret: there are only 48% positive interactions in Lazaret,
 whereas there are betwen 58% and 65% positive interactions elsewhere).
\end_layout

We also find the strong, positive influence of temperature on most groups
 of species, and a weak and negative effect and salinity.

What do we do now?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We could focus on toxic species only, which might be monitored more carefully
 than others, and check empirically the results from model-based papers
 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "diaz_climate_2013,gobler_ocean_2017"

\end_inset

.
 We could also use FLORPAR and FLORIND to follow the synchrony of toxic
 groups on more sites than the ones that are only followed with FLORTOT
 (see Rapport/graphe/time_series_florparind.pdf: we can confirm this by studying
 the species which are monitored at each site, and complete with FLORTOT
 but we have to keep in mind that methods differ: in FLORPAR/FLORIND, zeroes
 are 'real' because species are searched for).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can check the absence of competition between main groups (pennate, centric,
 dinoflagellates), as we observed in Teychan.
 Not sure we can do it for all sites.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We can also look at the interaction intra-group when they are well-monitored
 (but in this case, we can only use a subset of the previously defined subset)/
 We can check for compensation intra-site.

There are two ways to define the species which form the majority of the
 community.
 We can look at the overall relative abundance (ratio of cumulated abundance
 of a group over the total phytoplankton abundance through the all time
 series), or the presence of each group in the samples (number of sampling
 dates for which the group was not deemed as missing, over the total number
 of sampling dates).
 For Table 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "tab:Average-abundance-presence"

\end_inset

, we first ranked each groups according to its abundance or presence at
 each site and kept only the first 20 groups over 58.
 Then, we considered all groups and averaged abundance and presence values
 among all sites.
 It should be noted that for each computation, there were at least 10 species
 ranking in the most important species at all sites.

\begin_inset Caption Standard

\begin_layout Plain Layout
Comparison of AICc and BIC from different models: NEI is either used as
 a covariate (cov) or a group of species (sp) like CHA; and different interactio
n matrices are compared.
 This figure shows the difference between the AICc/BIC of a given model
 and the corresponding criterium of the null (diagonal interaction matrix)
 model with NEI as a covariate.
 A negative value indicates that the model performs better than the null
 model with NEI=cov.
 A positive value indicates that the null model is 'better'.
