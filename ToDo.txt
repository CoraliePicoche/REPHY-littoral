Things I'd like to check:
- compute the 'real' generality and vulnerability for each matrix. Is there a link with stability?
- compute mean N and P at different sites: are we limited?
- have a look at networklevel in package bipartite: does not seem to take into account the change in log-base
- compute CV=\frac{\sigma}{\mu} for each interaction
- Taxonomic level in SI
- % abundance we take into account at each site
- is there a difference in the ratio intra/inter or mean(effect) in the different modulus (for example, do dinoflagellates interact more with each other than the diatoms? Do they have a stronger self-regulation?)
